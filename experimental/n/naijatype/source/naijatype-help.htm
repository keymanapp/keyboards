<h2>On a computer with physical keyboard</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Press a key like the letter you want then use the semicolon to change its shape. <br/>
        eg <b>a ; → ə </b> <br/>
        <b> U ; → Ʉ </b><br/>
        <b> U ; ; ; → U̱</b>
    </li>
    <li>Type the top-left back tick (`) and hold shift and press tilde (~) keys to add diacritics above the previous letter.  <br/>
        eg <b>a ` → á</b><br/>
        <b> e ; ~ → ε̃ </b>
    </li>
    <li>Keep pressing these special keys to move through different options.</li>
    <li>The apostrophe, question mark and exclamation mark and dollar sign have several options activated by pressing the semicolon key. </li>
    <li>Try ctrl-alt (on a Mac option or ctrl-option) then a letter to get a variation shape, eg ctrl-alt-e = ɛ.</li>
    <li>Double press space bar to get a full stop followed by a space. </li>
    <li>Double press apostrophe to get a saltillo character (like an apostrophe, but word-forming and not turned into curly quotes by word-processors). Shift-apostrophe-apostrophe to get the capital version. ? then ; rotates through ¿ and then the modifier letter vertical line which is also sometimes used for a caseless glottal.</li>
    <li>Double press = to begin typing in ꜱᴍᴀʟʟ ᴄᴀᴘꜱ and double press = again to stop. This is useful when you need grammatical glosses or other small caps and the software you are using doesn't support small caps by styles. It uses different Unicode values.</li>
    <li>Underdot alternative: type main letter then ALT-FullStop, (Overdot with ALT-SHIFT-FullStop)</li>
    <li>Underline alternative: type letter then ALT-SHIFT-HYPHEN (overline with ALT-Hyphen)</li>
    <li>Vertical line above alternative: type letter then ALT-Backslash.</li>
</ul>
