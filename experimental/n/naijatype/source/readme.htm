	<p>
		Type every Nigerian language correctly on phones, tablets, iPads and systems. This keyboard helps you type the special letters (əɛɨʊɔŋɗɓƙ, ụndẹrdọts, u̱nde̱rli̱ne̱s) used in Nigerian orthographies and also the ₦aira sign. On touch you access special letters through a long press and on Windows/Mac/Linux by typing a modifier key to transform the previous shape, rather than using deadkeys. Keep pressing the same modifier key to change through several shape options, making it easy to learn and use.
	</p>

	<p>
		On desktop type the key closest to the symbol you want (a for ə or a̠, e for ɛ or ẹ etc) and then type the semicolon key. Keep typing semicolon to switch between different symbols.
After typing the base letter if you want a diacritic (tone mark or nasal) above the letter then type the top left 'back tick' key. For a nasal hold down shift as you type this.</p>
<p>
	On touch devices, press and hold down a key to see alternatives. For diacritics press and hold on the 'q' key at the top left.
