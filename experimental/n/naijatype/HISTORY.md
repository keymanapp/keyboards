Naija Type Keyboard Change History
=======================

June 2024
---------
* v61 m̃ easier on touch, ḅ underdot and line on desktop and touch, ɦ on touch. 105 languages known covered.

* v60 Doc updates, including assessment of more languages covered.

* v59 Missing flicks and defaults added. Now every popup key should have a sensible default (underdot on i e o) and also an upflick shape variant. Diagonal accent flicks had been missing from shift keys.

* v58 Added a load of (Requires Keyman 17) diagonal flicks for accents and down-flicks for all numbers on top row, side flicks on space bar and full stop (underdot), up-flicks for common alternate shapes. This should make use of the keyboard faster for power users. Added varying hopefully helpful defaults for the longpress menus. Updated the green hints. Updated documentation substantially.

May 2024
--------
* v57 Added 00; and 00/ > empty set especially for discourse work. Fixed defects in the Touch Keyboard text output (wrong layer selected) which stopped some combinations working in the shift layer. Began adding number down-flicks on top row.

* v49 Removed deprecated language features. Added Alt alternative (Alt/backslash) for vertical line above letter. Re-ordered code.
* v48 vertical line and overdot added to diacritics. Alt/ShiftAlt Alternatives to underline, overline, underdot and overdot combining chars added, and capital Q popup on touch keyboard. Also v popup for combining diacritics.
* v47 ctrl-alt ] or hyphen to produce [ and = in case one set of keys stops working (obscure keyboard problems!)
* v46 Compensate for Word etc autocurling the apostrophe into U+2018 or U+2019 by having a starting rota for those that ends in Saltillo
