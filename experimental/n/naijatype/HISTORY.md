Naija Type Keyboard Change History
=======================

64 (2025-Jun-9)
--------
* Added diaeresis/umlaut to the tone rota after over dot (esp for Kamuku) and Kanuri reversed e on the Q key. Also disable small caps mode when backspacing a small cap to help those who activate it accidentally.
* Updated the Andika font

63 (2024-Aug-20)
---------
* Update osk help file and related css to improve website behavior

62 (2024-Aug-13)
---------
* Corrected the New line indent for Description element

June 2024
---------
* v61 m̃ easier on touch, ḅ underdot and line on desktop and touch, ɦ on touch. 105 languages known covered.

* v60 Doc updates, including assessment of more languages covered.

* v59 Missing flicks and defaults added. Now every popup key should have a sensible default (underdot on i e o) and also an upflick shape variant. Diagonal accent flicks had been missing from shift keys.

* v58 Added a load of (Requires Keyman 17) diagonal flicks for accents and down-flicks for all numbers on top row, side flicks on space bar and full stop (underdot), up-flicks for common alternate shapes. This should make use of the keyboard faster for power users. Added varying hopefully helpful defaults for the longpress menus. Updated the green hints. Updated documentation substantially.

May 2024

* v47 ctrl-alt ] or hyphen to produce [ and = in case one set of keys stops working (obscure keyboard problems!)
