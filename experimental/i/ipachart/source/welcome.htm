<h1>IPAchart</h1>

<p>
    IPAchart gives you not all but the most frequently used IPA vowels, consonants, tone letters and diacritics tly as possible, laid out like an IPA chart. 
    It is probably easiest to use this on a tablet but it does work on larger phones.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Press the ➧ button to left of the vowels to expand the vowel section (hiding some consonants).  Press again to contract it. 
    <li>Flick up-right to get a vowel with a high tone mark, left-right to get mid tone, down-right to get low tone.
    <li>Press and hold to get alternate related symbols.
    <li>Double-tap to get aspirated plosives and syllabic nasals.
</ol>
