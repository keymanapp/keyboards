<h1>Start Using Dakota UMinn</h1>

<p>
  A Dakota language keyboard that uses the orthography popularized by the University of Minnesota. 
  This is also compatible with the orthography used by the Shakopee Mdewakantonwan Sioux Community.
</p>

<h1>Keyboard Layout</h1>

<p>
  The aspiration underdot has replaced the Q key. The acute accent has replaced the left bracket. 
  The overdot, of the SMSC variant of the orthography, has replaced the right bracket key. 
  To type these diacritics, simply press the key after the character to which they belong.
  All other non-English letters have been programmed to be a single keystroke. 
  Additionally, the keys for L and W have been swapped to make typing Dakota easier.

<p>
  All original keys can be accessed by holding down ALT while pressing the key. 
  This can be combined as SHIFT-ALT to access the uppercase versions. 
  This allows the user to type characters not ordinarily present in Dakota without completely switching keyboards.
