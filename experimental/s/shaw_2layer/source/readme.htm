<h1>Shaw 2-layer</h1>

<p>

A Keyman keyboard to allow users to type the English language in the Shavian alphabet. The Shavian alphabet is an alternative, phonemic way to write English. The alphabet takes its name from Irish writer Bernard Shaw who inspired and posthumously funded it. Shaw believed there should be a simpler way to write English. His wish was fulfilled in 1962 following a worldwide competition. The winner of that competition, Kingsley Read, developed an alphabet designed especially for English, with a unique letter for each of the 40 or so basic sounds we all use today.

Shaw 2-layer is a keyboard layout completely made from the ground up, taking advantage of features of the Shavian alphabet, mainly how most characters come in pairs. Consequently, this keyboard is intended for both beginners and for people who want to touch-type quickly in the Shavian alphabet.
