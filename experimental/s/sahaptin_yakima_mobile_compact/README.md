Description
-----------
This project provides a version of the mobile keyboard for both Android and iOS that features a compact layout with base characters visible with more "alternate" versions (long, accented, and/or hard versions) on key-hold options. This is recommended for those either more familiar with the practical alphabet and typing on a phone or a tablet. Those with larger screens could use the Full version.
