====================
This is the first version of the latin script for the Teggargrent (oua), we hope soon to have another two keyboards in Arabic and Tifinagh (Neo-tifinagh) trying to keep the same French Azerty position in booth.

This keyboard is create to work too in Tumzabt(mzb) and is based in a previous keyboard Tumzabt-Francais created on Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 and in the French keyboard for Android.
