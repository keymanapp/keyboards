Runeboard keyboard
==============

Description
-----------
The Runeboard keyboard is designed for typing the English language, using the runic script (Anglo-Saxon Fuþorc runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout.

This keyboard is also designed for typing the Proto-Germanic language, using the runic script (Elder Fuþark runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout. Consequently, it can also type other Germanic languages using the same script.

Although not designed for the purpose, this keyboard does have the ability to type the Old Norse language, using the runic script (Younger Fuþark runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout.

The layout contains the entire Unicode Runic Block, including the Franks Casket runes and the 3 novel runes invented by Tolkien. The ability of any given machine to display one or more of these characters may be limited by which fonts are installed on it. The font currently included with the Runeboard is Catrinity.
