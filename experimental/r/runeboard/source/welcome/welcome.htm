<h1>Start Using Runeboard</h1>

<p>This keyboard is designed for typing the English language, using the runic script (Anglo-Saxon Fuþorc runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout.</p>
<p>This keyboard is also designed for typing the Proto-Germanic language, using the runic script (Elder Fuþark runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout. Consequently, it can also type other Germanic languages using the same script.</p>
<p>Although not designed for the purpose, this keyboard does have the ability to type the Old Norse language, using the runic script (Younger Fuþark runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout.</p>
<p>The layout contains the entire Unicode Runic Block, including the Franks Casket runes and the 3 novel runes invented by Tolkien. The ability of any given machine to display one or more of these characters may be limited by which fonts are installed on it.</p>

<h2>Keyboard Layout</h2>

  <p>The K_Z key is the Zero Width Joiner [ZWJ]. In fonts which support bindrunes/ligatures, type it after another character and before another to create a supported bindrune.</p>
  <p>The space key outputs U+16EB RUNIC SINGLE PUNCTUATION. A regular space can be accessed throught the SHIFT+SPACE key. </p>

<h3>Tablet Layout</h3>
<p>Due to the size and number of keys, some characters are hidden in the long press. Press and hold on the key with a little dot on the top right to reveal and use them.</p>
<p>The number layer of the tablet layout includes the 3 runic calendar runes along with currency symbols, both Roman and Hindu-Arabic numerals, and a small selection of other useful characters. </p>
