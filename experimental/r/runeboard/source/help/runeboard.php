<p>This keyboard is designed for typing the English language, using the runic script (Anglo-Saxon Fuþorc runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout.</p>
<p>This keyboard is also designed for typing the Proto-Germanic language, using the runic script (Elder Fuþark runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout. Consequently, it can also type other Germanic languages using the same script.</p>
<p>Although not designed for the purpose, this keyboard does have the ability to type the Old Norse language, using the runic script (Younger Fuþark runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout.</p>
<p>The layout contains the entire Unicode Runic Block, including the Franks Casket runes and the 3 novel runes invented by Tolkien. The ability of any given machine to display one or more of these characters may be limited by which fonts are installed on it.</p>

<h2>Keyboard Layout</h2>


<h3>Desktop Keyboard Layout</h3>

<p>The spacebar outputs RUNIC SINGLE PUNCTUATION (U+16EB) followed by Zero Width Space [ZW SP] (U+200B). This enables tabbing between words in various desktop programmes.</p>
<p>A regular space can be accessed through the AltGr+SHIFT+SPACE key.</p>
<p>The SHIFT+SPACE key is the Zero Width Joiner [ZWJ] (U+200D). In fonts which support bindrunes/ligatures, type it after one rune and before another to create a supported bindrune.</p>
<p>The AltGr+SPACE key outputs a TRICOLON (U+205D) followed by Zero Width Space [ZW SP] (U+200B). This can be used to distinguish the unencoded "runic triple punctuation" mark from the RUNIC SINGLE PUNCTUATION (U+16EB) and RUNIC MULTIPLE PUNCTUATION (U+16EC), if necessary.</p>
