<p>This keyboard is designed for typing the English language, using the runic script (Anglo-Saxon Fuþorc runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout.</p>
<p>This keyboard is also designed for typing the Proto-Germanic language, using the runic script (Elder Fuþark runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout. Consequently, it can also type other Germanic languages using the same script.</p>
<p>Although not designed for the purpose, this keyboard does have the ability to type the Old Norse language, using the runic script (Younger Fuþark runes), with a standard 104- or 105-key layout.</p>
<p>The layout contains the entire Unicode Runic Block, including the Franks Casket runes and the 3 novel runes invented by Tolkien. The ability of any given machine to display one or more of these characters may be limited by which fonts are installed on it.</p>
