Modified Remington GAIL (SIL) keyboard Arabic numpad version

Modified by Danish Khan

This keyboard is a modified version of Remington-GAIL (SIL) keyboard where numpad keys are modified to type Arabic Numbers instead of Hindi numbers. This is done primarily to facilitate number typing by numpad as arabic numerals are widely used in India. Example : When pressing 1 on numpad, original keyboard types १ whereas this keyboard will type 1. Hindi numerals can always be typed using built in functionality using AltGr+number_row

Description
-----------

This keyboard is an implementation of the Remington-GAIL typewriter layout for 
inputting Unicode-compliant Devanagari. The layout was designed for Hindi input, 
but may suffice for other Devanagari script based languages. It faithfully 
implements the default and Shift keys of the legacy Remington-GAIL layout on a 
standard QWERTY keyboard. It also provides a number of additional characters 
from the APS Saral layout using the AltGr (Right Alt) and AltGR+Shift key modifiers.
