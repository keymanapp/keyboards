<h1>Remington GAIL (SIL) with Arabic Numpad</h1>

<p>This keyboard is a modified version of Remington-GAIL (SIL)
keyboard where numpad keys are modified to type Arabic Numbers
instead of Hindi numbers. This is done primarily to facilitate
number typing by numpad as arabic numerals are widely used in India.

Example : When pressing 1 on numpad, original keyboard types १
      whereas this keyboard will type 1.

      Hindi numerals can always be typed using built in functionality
      using AltGr+number_row
</p>

<p>
Remington-Gail (SIL) is an implementation of the Remington-GAIL typewriter
layout for inputting Unicode-compliant Devanagari.
The layout was designed for Hindi input, but may suffice for other Devanagari
script based languages. It faithfully implements the default and Shift keys of
the legacy Remington-GAIL layout on a standard QWERTY keyboard. It also
provides a number of additional characters from the APS Saral layout using the
AltGr (Right Alt) and AltGR+Shift key modifiers.</p>
<p>This keyboard was developed to fill the gap provided by two IMEs (APS Saral Hindi Indic Input 3 by Webdunia) and which are no longer supported on Windows and not available on other OSes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>APS Saral</li>
  <li> Hindi Indic Input 3 </li>
</ul>
