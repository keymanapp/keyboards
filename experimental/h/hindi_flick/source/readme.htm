  <h1>Hindi Flick</h1>
  <p>
    <b>
      A mobile keyboard layout designed for Hindi, utilizing a flick input method.
    </b>
  </p>

  Hindi Flick is a mobile keyboard layout based on the Varnamala, where each key corresponds to a set of syllables.
  It is inspired by the flick-based layout popular in Japan as well as Vietnamese TELEX with regards to diacritic rules.
  <br><br>
  The layout is as follows:
  <br><br>
  <center>
    <img src="./layout.png" style="height: 75%; width: 75%;">
  </center>

  <br>
  There are 16 total keys, with 12 in the center being swipeable in multiple directions, longpress-able and multitap-able.
