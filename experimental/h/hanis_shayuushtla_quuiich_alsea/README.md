hanis_siuslaw_shayuushtla_quuiich_alsea keyboard
==============

Description
-----------
This keyboard was made by Jordan AG Douglas-Tavani for typing hanis kuukwis (Hanis), miluk kuukwis (Miluk), shaʼyuushtlʼa, quuiich, and alsea in accordance with the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians classroom orthography. The computer-based keyboard does not represent every sound in the languages, but rather, the characters used to create those sounds. This means that the 'ch' sound is created by combining both the characters of 'c' and 'h'. Meanwhile, the mobile keyboards have longpress utilization. This allows for all sounds in the language to be represented, such as 'ch', 'sh', 'hw', etc.; with their own keys. 
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns or if you need any help, please reach out to Jordan Douglas-Tavani at jdouglas@ucsb.edu. If you would like to contact the tribe, please reach out to Enna Helms at ehelms@ctclusi.org.
