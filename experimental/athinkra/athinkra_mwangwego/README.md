The Athinkra Experimental Mwangwego Keyboard
======================================

Copyright (C) Athinkra, LLC

This is an experimental keyboard for the Mwangwego script. It requires the included “Mwangwego Book” font which
in turn encodes the script under its provisional encoding for Unicode 19. See the typing manual for full details
of the typing rules. Since this keyboard uses a provisional encoding, those codepoints can change. Any documents
created using this keyboard could become obsolete if the codepoint assignments change.
