The GFFSheik Bakri Sapalo Keyboard
=========================================

Copyright (C) 2023 Geʾez Frontier Foundation

Version 1.0.0

This is a Geʾez (ግዕዝ, ISO-639-2 gez) language mnemonic input method. They keyboard is designed
to work with the [EMUFI](https://emufi.geez.org/) project’s “Geʾez Manuscript Zemen” font (v1.2) which in turn 
provides numerous punctuation, numerals, and letter forms found in manuscripts but not yet available under 
the Unicode standard.

In essence, this is the [GFF Geʾez Keyboard](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/tree/master/release/gff/gff_geez)
with the added ability to type over 1,000 additional symbols found in Geʾez manuscripts.

Caveats
-------
The keyboard should *only* be used with the understanding that the accompanying “Geʾez Manuscript Zemen” font 
is experimental and the additional symbols that it provides are *not* recognized by international standards
at this time.

The consequence of using the font at this time is that, documents that use the “Geʾez Manuscript Zemen” font are *not*
guaranteed to work with future versions of the font, or with other fonts designed for Geʾez. The additional
symbols may then not be visible in the document with a later version of the font, or may appear as entirely 
different symbols.

The “Geʾez Manuscript Zemen” font *is* guaranteed to be stable with in a *major* version, meaning version `1.2` will
be compatible with version `1.3`, `1.4`, etc. but may not be be fully compatible with versions `2.0` and later.  
A document conversion utility is planned to assist with conversion from older to newer versions of the font.

Some of the added symbols may later be supported by the Unicode standard, in which case the adopted symbols will 
then become available under other Geʾez fonts and the “Geʾez Manuscript Zemen” font will be revised accordingly.
