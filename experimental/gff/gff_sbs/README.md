The GFF Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo Keyboard
======================================

Copyright (C) Ge æez Frontier Foundation

This is a keyboard for typing the Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo script in a style very similar to typing in Qubee Latin.
Qubee Latin rules for typing Oromo language sounds are followed to the maximum extent possible,
in a few cases where the Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo script adds additional letters for the sounds
of other languages (Arabic for example), a small change from Qubee is introduced.  See the typing
manual for full details of the typing rules.

Caveats
-------
This is an *exerimental* keyboard that will not be compatible with a future standard for the Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo
script. The font that the keyboard relies on, the  _Sheek Bakri Saphaloo_  font, uses a temporary encoding
space that would change under a final standard for the script. The implication is that documents composed with
this typeface will be incompatible with the anticipated international standard and will either need to be
recomposed on converted into the standard encoding.
