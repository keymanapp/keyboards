<p>
  This is a phonetic-based keyboard designed for the Zaghawa Beria language using the Beria Erfe script. Beria Erfe is not yet in Unicode.
</p>

<p><em>The Beria Erfe script has received <a href="https://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html">provisional codepoint assignments</a> by the Unicode Technical Committee. The script has not yet been formally accepted and approved for a future version of the Unicode Standard. The Kedebideri font, and this keyboard, are using the provisional codepoints, but those codepoints can always change. Should those codepoints change, the font <em>and keyboard</em> would be re-released with the new encoding. Documents would then need converting to use the new codepoints.</em></p>
