Notes for using the Georgian Keyman keyboard
============================================

1. Unicode standard encoding is used, so any Unicode fonts containing the (Georgian) Mkhedruli alphabet can be used (e.g. Sylfaen, MS Arial Unicode, etc.)

2. Other specific Georgian Unicode fonts may be obtained from various internet sites. The following sites may be helpful in this regard:

Please note:
------------

The Georgian keyboard was supplied by Giorgi Shonia <gshonia@indiana.edu> and all inquiries concerning layout and use must be directed to him, not to Tavultsoft.
