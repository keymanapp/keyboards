README - WINDOWSGentium Release 1.0228 November 2005========================Thank you for your interest in the Gentium fonts.We hope you find them useful!Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface familydesigned to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who usethe Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. It supportsa wide range of Latin-based alphabets and includes glyphs that correspond toall the Latin ranges of Unicode.The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, andvisually attractive. The additional 'extended' Latin letters are designed tonaturally harmonize with the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treatedwith careful thought and attention to their use. Gentium also supports bothancient and modern Greek, including a number of alternate forms. It has wona "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design" in two major internationaltypeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001) and TDC2003 (2003).Gentium provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Greek characters.It currently supports the following ranges of Unicode 3.0 (completely unlessnoted):Range           Description---------------------------U+0020-U+007F 	Basic LatinU+00A0-U+00FF 	Latin-1 SupplementU+0100-U+017F 	Latin Extended-AU+0180-U+021F 	Latin Extended-BU+0222-U+0233 	Latin Extended-B (continued)U+0250-U+02AD 	IPA ExtensionsU+02B0-U+02FF 	Spacing Modifier LettersU+0300-U+036F 	Combining Diacritical MarksU+0370-U+03D5 	Greek (not including archaic or Coptic)U+1E00-U+1EFF 	Latin Extended AdditionalU+1F00-U+1FFF 	Greek ExtendedU+2000-U+203A 	General Punctuation (partial)U+2070-U+209F 	Superscripts and SubscriptsU+20A0-U+20CF 	Currency Symbols (partial)U+2100-U+214F 	Letterlike Symbols (only a couple)Gentium Regular also includes some Cyrillic glyphs, but they are only earlydrafts. A future version will include a completely revised set, and willexpand the support for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to cover Unicode 4.1. Itwill also include support for OpenType, Graphite and AAT smart fonttechnologies.Gentium is released under the SIL Open Font License.Gentium is a trademark of SIL International.	See the OFL and OFL-FAQ for details of the SIL Open Font License.See the FONTLOG for information on this and previous releases.See the QUOTES file to read the feedback received from Gentium users.See the GENTIUM-FAQ file for frequently asked questions and their answers	(such as why there are two families of fonts included).TIPS====We cannot afford to offer free technical support. The font has, however, been through some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in mostsituations. In particular, it has been tested and shown to work on Windows2000 and Windows XP.If you do find a problem, please do report it to <gentium AT sil DOT org>.We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs infuture versions. Make sure you read through the Gentium FAQ.Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understandingof the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:Encoding: The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must supportUnicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.Keyboarding:Gentium does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. It uses thebuilt-in keyboards of the operating system. You will need to install theappropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the language youwish to use. If you want to enter characters that are not supported by anysystem keyboard, the Keyman program (www.tavultesoft.com) can be helpful.Another method of entering some symbols is provided by a few applicationssuch as Adobe InDesign. They can display a glyph palette that shows all theglyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter them by clicking on theglyph you want.Rendering:Gentium also currently lacks any special font programming that cansubstitute one glyph for another or position glyphs in a 'smart' way, suchas in OpenType, Apple Advanced Typography or SIL's Graphite. For example,although Gentium includes an 'ffl' ligature, there are no special routinesin the font that will automatically substitute 'f'+'f'+'l' with 'ffl', butan individual application might provide that feature.INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION==============================In Windows XP, open the Fonts control panel (Start, Control Panel,Appearance and Themes, then look in the upper left).
