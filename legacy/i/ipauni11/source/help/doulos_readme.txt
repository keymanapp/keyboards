Doulos SIL FAQ (http://scripts.sil.org/ComplexRomanFontFAQ) for frequently
asked questions and their answers.

TIPS
====

We cannot afford to offer free technical support. The font has, however, 
been through some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most
situations. In particular, it has been tested and shown to work on Windows
2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista. Graphite capabilities have been tested 
on Graphite-supported platforms.

If you do find a problem, please do report it to <fonts AT sil DOT org>.
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in
future versions. Make sure you read through the 
Doulos SIL FAQ (http://scripts.sil.org/ComplexRomanFontFAQ).

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding:
Doulos SIL does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. It uses the
built-in keyboards of the operating system. You will need to install the
appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the language you
wish to use. If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any
system keyboard, the Keyman program (www.tavultesoft.com) can be helpful
on Windows systems. Also available for Windows is MSKLC 
(http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx). 
For Linux systems, KMFL (http://kmfl.sourceforge.net/)
is available. Ukelele (http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele) is available for Mac OS X 
versions 10.2 and later.

Another method of entering some symbols is provided by a few applications
such as Adobe InDesign. They can display a glyph palette that shows all the
glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter them by clicking on the
glyph you want.

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with any of three advanced font technologies, 
Graphite, AAT or OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite, AAT or OpenType. See "Applications
that provide an adequate level of support for SIL Unicode Roman fonts" 
(http://scripts.sil.org/Complex_AdLvSup).
