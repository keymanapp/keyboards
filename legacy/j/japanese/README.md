Japanese Keyboard
============================

(c) 2010-2020 SIL International

Version 1.0

__DESCRIPTION__
This keyboard is designed for the Japanese language as used in Japan (and elsewhere).  
Japanese text is entered using Latin alphabet characters (W&#x0101;puro r&#x014d;maji) for 
the corresponding Japanese letters, and are output as the equivalent Hiragana or Katakana.  
An "input method editor" (IME) window is used to select from a  list of matching Kanji 
characters (with or without okurigana).
