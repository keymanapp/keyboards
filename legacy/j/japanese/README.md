Description
-----------
This keyboard is designed for the Japanese language as used in Japan (and elsewhere).
Japanese text is entered using Latin alphabet characters (W&#x0101;puro r&#x014d;maji) for
the corresponding Japanese letters, and are output as the equivalent Hiragana or Katakana.
An "input method editor" (IME) window is used to select from a  list of matching Kanji
characters (with or without okurigana).
