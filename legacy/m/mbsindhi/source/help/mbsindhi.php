This keyboard is designed for the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindhi_language"><b>Sindhi</b></a> language of Sindh, in its standard Arabic script, as used in Pakistan and India.  It is based on phonetic keyboard for Sindhi developed by Abdul-Majid Bhurgri for Macintosh in 1988, and later approved by Sindhi Language Authority, and used in Windows, Mac OSX and Linux Ubuntu as MBSindhi keyboard.
