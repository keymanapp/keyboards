<p>Accented letters are formed by typing the appropriate letter, followed by the
key listed below for the appropriate accent mark. Note that you will need an
appropriate iso-8859-3 compatible font to view these glyphs correctly.</p>

<p>`	grave			(A E  I  O U)</p>
<p>^	circumflex		(ACEGHIJ OSU)</p>
<p>:	diaeresis (umlaut)	(A E  I  O U)</p>
<p>-	bar (stroke)		    (H)</p>
<p>-	breve			   (G      U)</p>
<p>'	acute			(A E  I  O U)</p>
<p>.	dot			 (C G I     Z)</p>
<p>~	tilde			       (N)</p>
<p>,	cedilla			 (C       S)</p>

<p>If you need an unaccented letter followed by one of the above punctuation marks,
simply type the punctuation mark twice. This Taveultesoft keyboard is good for
typing Maltese or Esperanto. Other languages are not officially supported by
the iso-8859-3 standard. However, meaning Western European languages can be written
using this standard, including English, French, and German.</p>
