          <p>You have just completed the installation process for your
          Syllabics keyboard map and syllabics fonts.</p>
          <p>To turn your Syllabics keyboard on and off, you should see a “K” icon in your System Tray (at the bottom-right of your screen). When you left-click this icon, a list of installed keyboards should appear, choose
          <tt><strong>the name of your language and dialect</strong></tt> to turn on the syllabics, and select <tt><strong>No Keyman Keyboard</strong></tt> to revert back to English.</p>
          <p>If this “K” icon is not in your System Tray, you will need to turn the Keyman software on to type in
          Syllabics. </p>
