Explanatory Notes for using the Cheyenne Keyboard
-------------------------------------------------

This keyboard allows one to keyboard the special symbols used in the modern
Cheyenne alphabet. If you have turned on the Tavultesoft keyboard, you can
get an accent mark over a vowel by typing the [ symbol then the vowel. You
can get a whisper mark over a vowel by typing the ^ mark (above the 6) then
the vowel. And you can get the "esh" ("duck") mark (s with a little v over
it) by typing the ^ mark then s. If you also use a Cheyenne font, such as
"Chey 1 SILSophiaL," the whisper mark will appear over the vowels as a dot,
instead of the ^ mark.
