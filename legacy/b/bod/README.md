Bod keyboard

(c) 2015 

Version 1.1

Description
-----------

Keyboard for Central Tibetan.

This keyboard was contributed in 2015 under the MIT license. At this point we do not have the source files, 
nor a record of the author's name.

This keyboard was originally under the "legacy" folder. We have moved it into "experimental" in order to 
allow the system to automatically build a .kmp for it to be able to be distributed. Nevertheless, we do
not have the source files to develop the keyboard further.
