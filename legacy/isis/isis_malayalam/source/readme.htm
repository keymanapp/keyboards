This keyboard lets you type in Malayalam.  It is one of the ISIS set of keyboards, which allow typing in all Indian languages.
The keyboard is phonetic, which means it follows the English (QWERTY) layout.  This makes it easy for people who are learning Malayalam to use, as well as for Malayalam speakers.
