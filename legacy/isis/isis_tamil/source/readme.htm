	<p>This keyboard is designed for the Tamil language, and is part of the ISIS set of keyboards designed to allow typing in all Indic languages.  It is a phonetic keyboard, which means the Tamil characters are arranged according to the letters of the English keyboard.  This makes it easy to use for people learning Tamil, as well as Tamil speakers.  Typing follows a consonant-vowel pattern, and the keyboard is designed for use with a normal QWERTY (English) keyboard.
