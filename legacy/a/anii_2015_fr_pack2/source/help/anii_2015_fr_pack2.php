<p>This keyboard is purpose made for writing the Anii language (code BLO) as it is spoken in Benin and Togo, namely at </p>
<p>Afem, Ag&eacute;r&eacute;nd&eacute;bou, Balanka, Bassila, Bayak&#650;, Bodi, Dengou, Frignion, Guiguisso, Kodowari, Kouloumi, Mboroko, Melan, Nagayil&eacute;, Nandjoubi, P&eacute;nessoulou,
P&eacute;n&eacute;lan, Saramanga, Yari</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This keyboard works best, when used on a French keyboard (hardware) as its layout follows the French layout for most characters. This keyboard also works great as an on-screen keyboard for clicking (for example
on websites) and not least as a touch-keyboard on Android and iOS devices (tablets and smartphones, landscape and portraid mode).</p>
