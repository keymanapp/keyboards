  "description": "This is the mnemonic version of the SIL Pan Africa keyboard. It features a layout that adjusts to the arrangement of keys on your hardware keyboard. For a keyboard tailored to the US hardware keyboard, use 'Pan Africa (for US Keyboards)'. \r\n\r\nThis keyboard was developed to type the Latin-script languages of Africa. It was created using data received from SIL entities in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo. Where possible, the keystroke sequences that the majority of the entities seemed to prefer was used.\r\n\r\nThe Keyman source file is provided as a part of the package for convenience in modifying the keyboard.\r\n\r\nFor the official release of this SIL keyboard package, visit:\r\n  http://scripts.sil.org/AfricanKeyboard1",
