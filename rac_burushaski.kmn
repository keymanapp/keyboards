Burushaski (/bʊrʊˈʃæski/; Burushaski: burū́šaskī / بروشسکی‎) is a language isolate spoken by Burusho people who reside almost entirely in northern Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan,with a few hundred speakers in northern Jammu and Kashmir, India. In Pakistan, Burushaski is spoken by people in Hunza-Nagar District, northern Gilgit District, and in the Yasin and Ishkoman valleys of northern Ghizer District. Their native region is located in northern Gilgit–Baltistan and borders with Pamir corridor to the north. In India, Burushaski is spoken in Botraj Mohalla of the Hari Parbat region in Srinagar. Other names for the language are Biltum, Khajuna, Kunjut, Brushaski, Burucaki, Burucaski, Burushaki, Burushki, Brugaski, Brushas, Werchikwar and Miśa:ski.
It is based on phonetic keyboard for Burushaski Language developed by Pakistani linguist, author, researcher and Software Developer Mr.Rehmat Aziz Chitrali for Summer Institute of Linguistics(SIL), Keyman, Tavultesoft and later approved by Khowar Academy(an literary Association working on the language and culture documentation in Northern Pakistan) used in Windows 8.1 and above as Burushaski Keyboard.
c This is the first Burushaski language keyboard created by Rehmat Aziz Chitrali, Pakistani linguist, Software Developer and Researcher. This keyboard is for Burushaski Language based on the keyboard layout as developed by Mr.Rehmat Aziz Chitrali and approved by Khowar Academy of Pakistan as standard keyboard for Burushaski language.
c The Burushaski Keyboard Project(BKP) was supervised and developed by Rehmat Aziz Chitrali, who heads the Khowar Academy Chitral Pakistan. The project was developed in collaboration with Lorna Evans of SIL International.
c Khowar Academy Chitral was established in April 1996 specifically to promote the endangered  languages of Chitral Pakistan. The Academy has worked extensively on Burushaski linguistics, standardization for computing, and modeling of script, speech and language.
