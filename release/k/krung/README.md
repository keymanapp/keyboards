Description
-----------

Krung is a language spoken in the northern part of Cambodia. Khmer script was adopted and used for this language. This Keyman keyboard was developed based on an existing tool (Clever Rabit) which used the Romanized version of Krung. However, a few customizations have been made to make this keyboard perform as expected. See the documentation on the romanization and examples in our welcome page.

ToDo
-------------------
* Backspace functionality is not implemented yet, do we have to have it? Chuck said, "I think it would be useful for quick correcting of mistakes as one keys in words but I don’t know how complicated it would be to add this."
* Also the keys for ៕ and ៚, where should these characters be placed?
