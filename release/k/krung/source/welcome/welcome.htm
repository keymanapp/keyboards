<h1>Keyboard Usage</h1>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc,">
<li>U+200D on key F is used to prevent consonant from becoming a consonant cluster when necessary, especially in disyllabic words. For example, when type "mraa", the output is "ម្រ៉ា", but if type "mfraa", the output would be មរ៉ា.
</li>
<li>You do not need to type character "a" in the presyllable of disyllabic words. For example, to get បនិះ, type "bnih", not "banih". :)
</li>
<li>Key "q", when type at the word final position, nothing would be output, but there are two choices to pick from, and you can do it manually: (1) គ in the output or (2) គ not in the output (you may use Backspace for this :) ).
</li>
<li>Example #154 is conflicted with the Clever Rabit output. 
</li>
</ul>
