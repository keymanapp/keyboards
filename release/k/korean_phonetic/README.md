Description
-----------

The Korean Phonetic keyboard creates Korean hangeul from jamo each time you press Spacebar.

The Korean Phonetic keyboard is built to type Korean using Phonetic transliteration when possible. This layout is designed to make Latin-Korean transliteration 100% unambiguous.

This mnemonic keyboard is based on the pronunciation of Korean. For an alternative accurate transliteration system, use the Korean KORDA keyboards.
