Change History
=======================

1.5 (26 Oct 2020)
--------------------
* Add Andika font to the package 
* Update numeric layer 

1.4.1 (18 Jun 2018)
-------------------
* Add touch keyboard to package

1.4 (16 Oct 2017)
-----------------
* Realized that the semicolon is used in the Kayǎn orthography so added it back. It had been removed for the U+02CA value but that was a temporary fix. So now is a good time to put the semicolon back in its original place.

1.3 (4 Sep 2017)
----------------
* Changed the U+02CA to U+0301.
* Despite the visual look of U+02CA, U+0301 was strongly advised to be used until features can be made in later releases of fonts. Then the diacritics will stack correctly and publications will look right.

1.2 (17 Aug 2017)
-----------------
* Fixed a number of keys on the touch keyboard. 
* The display and output on those keys were different but now are the same.

1.1 (21 July 2017)
------------------
* Changed folder structure to match Keyman's requirements.
* Changed ; to U+02CA.
* Added icon file.
* Added keyboard display.

1.0 (20 July 2017)
------------------
* First attempt at getting the Kayan keyboard to Keyman's repository.
