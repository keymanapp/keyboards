Change History
=======================

1.0 (20 July 2017)
------------------

First attempt at getting the Kayan keyboard to Keyman's repository.

------------------
1.1 (21 July 2017)
------------------

Changed folder structure to match Keyman's requirements.
Changed ; to U+02CA.
Added icon file.
Added keyboard display.

-----------------
1.2 (17 Aug 2017)
-----------------

Fixed a number of keys on the touch keyboard. 
The display and output on those keys were different but now are the same.

----------------
1.3 (4 Sep 2017)
----------------

Changed the U+02CA to U+0301.
Despite the visual look of U+02CA, U+0301 was strongly advised to be used until features can be made in later releases of fonts. Then the diacritics will stack correctly and publications will look right.

-----------------
1.4 (16 Oct 2017)
-----------------

Realized that the semicolon is used in the Kayǎn orthography so added it back. It had been removed for the U+02CA value but that was a temporary fix. So now is a good time to put the semicolon back in its original place.

1.4.1 (18 Jun 2018)
-------------------
