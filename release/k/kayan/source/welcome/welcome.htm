<h1>Welcome to the Kayǎn Keyboard</h1>

<h2>Key sequences</h2>
<p>First type the vowel and then the vowel change marks and then the tone marks after the vowel.</p>

<h2>Fonts</h2>
<p>There is a problem with many fonts not stacking diacritics correctly.</p>
<p>Charis SIL displays all the stacked diacritics correctly except the U+0300 and U+0301 sequence.</p>
<p>In this version of the keyboard we've changed ; to U+02CA to help with this problem. We are working on a better solution. </p>
