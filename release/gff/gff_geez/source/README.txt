========================

Thank you for your interest in the Abyssinica SIL font.
We hope you find it useful!

Abyssinica SIL provides glyphs for a wide range of Ethiopic and Latin.
Please read the online documentation to see what ranges are supported.

or the Abyssinica SIL FAQ (http://scripts.sil.org/AbyssinicaSIL_Support) 
for frequently asked questions and their answers.


TIPS
====

We cannot afford to offer free technical support. The font has, however, 
been through some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most
situations. In particular, it has been tested and shown to work on Windows 
XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.

If you do find a problem, please do report it to <fonts AT sil DOT org>.
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in
future versions. Make sure you read through the 
Abyssinica SIL FAQ (http://scripts.sil.org/AbyssinicaSIL_Support).

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding:
Abyssinica SIL can be used with any Unicode Ethiopic keyboarding program. 
However, we have included a Keyman keyboard which you will need to download 
separately (SILEthiopicKeymanKbd.kmp). You will need to install the
the Keyman program (http://keyman.com/) prior to installing the Keyman
keyboard. Please read the documentation (readme.html) 
which comes with the keyboard to learn the keyboard sequences.

This keyboard is also provided for use with KMFL. Please read the
documentation (readme.html) which comes with the keyboard to learn the 
keyboard sequences.

Another method of entering some symbols is provided by a few applications
such as Adobe InDesign. They can display a glyph palette that shows all the
glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter them by clicking on the
glyph you want.

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with either of two advanced font technologies, 
Graphite or OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType. See "Applications
that provide an adequate level of support for SIL Unicode Roman fonts" 
(http://scripts.sil.org/Complex_AdLvSup).


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
==============================
