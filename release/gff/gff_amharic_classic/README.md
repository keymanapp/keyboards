አማርኛ (Amharic) Classic Keyboard
==============================

Copyright (C) 1997-2020 Ge'ez Frontier Foundation, SIL International

Version 2.0

This is an Amharic (amh, አማርኛ) language mnemonic input method for mobile platforms based on a US-QWERTY layout. The package should *only* be installed on mobile and tablet devices.

Technical Note
--------------
This package is identical to the `gff_amharic` keyboard where only the `.keyman-touch-layout` is different.  The touch layout is the continuation of the QWERTY based touch layout provided in the `gff_amharic` package prior to version 2.0.  The package is intended to provide the "classic" touch layout *only* and is *not* intended for use on non-touch enviornments. For a desktop version of the keyboard the `gff_amharic` package should be installed instead.
