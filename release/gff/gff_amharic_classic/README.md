# አማርኛ (Amharic) Classic Keyboard

Copyright © Geʾez Frontier Foundation


## Description

This is an Amharic (amh, አማርኛ) language mnemonic input method for mobile platforms designed in the
style of English “QWERTY” layout as found on iPhones and iPads.
The package should *only* be installed on mobile and tablet devices.
The keyboard is also suitable for Tigirnya and Agew languages such as Awngi, Blin, and Khimtanga.

### Keyboard Initial State
The keyboard begins in the familiar layout used on English (Latin Alphabet) keyboards:

The keyboard updates as you type.  For example, this is the keyboard change after pressing the ግ key:

### Keyboard Shifted State
Just as with English keyboards, the SHIFT key makes more letters appear:

### Flick Typing
Every key supports "flicking" to making typing even faster.  See the help file for full details.

### Multitap Typing
Every key also supports "multitaps" to making typing even faster.  See the help file for full details.

## Technical Note

This package is identical to the `gff_amharic` keyboard where only the `.keyman-touch-layout` is different. 
The touch layout is the continuation of the QWERTY-based touch layout provided in the `gff_amharic` package prior to version 2.0.  The package is intended to provide the "classic" touch layout *only* and is *not* intended for use on non-touch environments. For a desktop version of the keyboard the `gff_amharic` package should be installed instead.
