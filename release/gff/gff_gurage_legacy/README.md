ጉራጊና (Gurage) Legacy Keyboard
============================

Copyright (C) 2008-2020 Ge'ez Frontier Foundation

Version 0.1

This is a Gurage (ጉራጌ , ISO-639-2 swg-Ethi) language mnemonic input method.  It requires a font
supporting Ethiopic script under the Unicode 4.1 standard. This keyboard is the immediate
successor to the GFF Sebatbeit keyboard (gff-sgw-7.kmn version 7.0).

The keyboard is given the name "Legacy" because it is designed to work with the Gurage
orthography introduced in the 1966 publication *Ethiopians Speak: Studies in Cultural
Background, Volume 2. Chaha* and successor orthographies through the formal adoption by
the Unicode 4.1 standard published in 2005. The following fonts are packaged with the
keyboard representing different stages of the evolution of the orthography.  All fonts
have been derived from [Abyssinica SIL](https://software.sil.org/abyssinica/).

* Gurage Fider 1966 - the initial orthography devised by Dr. Wolf Leslau and Sahle Selassie
                      Berhane Mariam in 1962 and published in 1966 in the seminal work:
                      *Ethiopians Speak: Studies In Cultural Background. Volume 2. Chaha.*

* Gurage Fider 1977 - an orthography developed independently between 1974-1977 by Carolyn Ford
                      and Degefe Gebre Mariam and first used in publishing a selection of
                      the Gospel of Matthew on January 7, 1977 and later used to publish the
                      Gurage New Testament (ገደር ጕርዳ በጕራጊና) in 1983.

* Gurage Fider 1998 - the successor to the 1977 orthography developed to publish the 
                      Gurage Bible and becoming the reference glyphs under Unicode 4.1.
                      The glpyhs have been in use from 1998 until a new orthography was
                      introduced in 2013. The glpyhs may also be generated from the
                      [TypeTuner website](https://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts3go.cgi)
                      with the language selection "Sebat Bet Gurage".
