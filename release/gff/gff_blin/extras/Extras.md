* `gff_blin-with-popups.keyman-touch-layout` - a snapshot of a near final version of the keyboard that used popups for syllable selection.  This file is stashed here to save work later should the decision be made to go back to popups.
* `make-kb-layers.pl` - the script used to duplicate layers, last set for tablet layers.
* `gff_blin-jacket-red.ico` - The keyboard icon based on the Tekie Alibekit's famous red jacket. It proved too be a little too dark, but I might try again pending feedback. 
* `gff_blin-orig.ico` - The icon used in previous versions, possibly we will return to it pending feedback.
* `sideimage-bin-animated.png` - A version of the side image that uses animation, it may be used when the installer can support animated PNG images.
* `sideimage-blin-house.png` - An alternative version of the side image that may be used at a later time or with a derived project.
