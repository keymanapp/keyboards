Version 1.1

This is a language-neutral touch (only) keyboard for mobile devices. The keyboard provides all Ethiopic letters in active use on a single layer in a circular, semi-clockwise orientation. It is meant to be intuitive for new typists but supports faster typing for experienced typists compared to the similar [Mesobe Fidelat Keyboard](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/tree/master/release/gff/gff_mesobe_fidelat) keyboard.

## Keyboard Layers

The mobile keyboard uses the “Mesob” style layout of letters where letters are arranged in a series of 4 rings.  Modifier keys that will change the vowel of a letter appear dynamically on screen in selection “Halos”. 

The Mesob layout also has the goal of providing *all* letters actively used b the languages written with Geʾez script in a single keyboard “layer”. Given the high number of letters appearing on the keyboard, it is a better fit for larger size mobile phones.   Consider using the more compact [GFF Amharic Keyboard](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/tree/master/release/gff/gff_amharic) for regular sized mobile phones.

### Letters

The most frequently used letters generally appear in inner rings, and less used letters appear in the out rings. Letters are arranged in a semi-alphabetic arrangement in the clockwise direction, but not strictly so.  Some effort is made to group related letters together (related either by sound or shape).

Tapping a key once enters it on to the screen in the 6th (ሳድስ) form and a “halo” appears on the keyboard of the related letters. Tapping a related letter will update the first letter, or tap the 6th letter again to go back to the starting keyboard.

Note the highlighted arrow button, `▶`, above the Enter key, it will appear for large families of related letters.  When you need them, the `▶` button will bring up a 2nd halo of letters that are used less frequently. Note the reverse `◀` botton which will go back to the first halo.
