Description
-----------

The GFF Musnad keyboard supports the entry of Musnad Script which is also commonly referred to as “Old South Arabian” 
and “Sabaean” script by different communities. Musnad and the languages that used it continue to be important to the
studies of Semitic languages.  Musnad was written in either the boustrophedon style of writing or in the right-to-left
direction.  The keyboard is agnostic to the writing direction and leaves it to the editor application to control the direction
of text.

The  “Qataban”  font included with this archive was developed by Dr. Bronson Brown-deVost (Bronson.Brown-deVost@theologie.uni-goettingen.de)
and made  available under the OpenFont License (OFL).  The Qatalan glyphs assume the right-to-left direction
a future revision is expected to provide the left-to-right versions of relevant glyphs available through a stylistic set.
