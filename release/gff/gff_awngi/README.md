Awngi & Xamtanga Keyboard
=====================

Copyright (C) 2009-2017 Ge'ez Frontier Foundation

Version 1.2

This is an Awngi (awn, አውጚ) and Xamtanga (xan, ኻምጣጛ) language mnemonic input method.  It requires
a font supporting Ethiopic script under the Unicode 4.1 standard. The input method is also
suitable for the large Ximtanga (Khimtanga, ኽምጣጛ) dialect of Xamtanga.  The input method
should be suitable for the related Qimant (ahg, ቅማንት) language though may provide excess letters
not required by Qimant.

The Awngi & Xamtanga letter inventory is based on the syllabary of Dr. Alamirew Gebrehiwet which
was submitted in the request for input for DES:5214 which later became the Ethiopian standards
ES 781:2002.  The syllabary in turn had a focus on Ximtanga and Xamtanga requirements.  The
inventory is believed to be suitable for Awngi as well.
