<p>
    A Keyman keyboard for the Vai language of Liberia, developed by the team at Athinkra, LLC.
</p>
<p>Because there are so many characters in the Vai script, this keyboard requires multiple keystrokes to access most of the characters.</p>

<h1>Keyboard Layout</h1>
<p>Vowel marks are on the corresponding vowel keys. Syllable Ng is also on a keycap. 
	<p>To type a consonant, you must type the consonant first, and then the vowel. For example:</p>
<ul>ɓꔀ (be) will produce ꔇ.</ul>
	<p>To type a nasal vowel, you must type the vowel first, and then the tilde. For example:</p>
<ul>ꕉ~ (a~) will produce ꕊ.</ul>
<ul>hꔤ~ (hi~) will produce ꔥ.</ul>

	<p>To type a breathy character, you must type the consonant first, then the h, and then the vowel. For example:</p>
<ul>bhꔤ (bhi) will produce ꔫ.</ul>

<p>Similar characters can be formed by typing "dl", "gb", "kp", "mgb", "mb", "nd", "ng", "ngg", "nj", and "ny" followed by a vowel. </p>

<p>The hyphen characters on the RIGHT ALT layer are used for accessing historic syllables. Type the character followed by a vowel and the historic syllable will be formed. There are not historic syllables for every vowel, so the hyphen may remain in the text unexpectedly).</p>
