<p>
    A Keyman keyboard for the Vai language of Liberia, developed by the team at Athinkra, LLC. This keyboard uses fewer keystrokes than the "Vai (Athinkra)" keyboard and is more ergonomic.
</p>
<p>Because there are so many characters in the Vai script, this keyboard requires multiple keystrokes to access most of the characters.</p>

<h1>Keyboard Layout</h1>
<p>Vowel marks and nasilized vowels are on the corresponding vowel keys.  
	<p>To type a consonant, you must type the consonant first, and then the vowel. For example:</p>
<ul>ɓꔀ (be) will produce ꔇ.</ul>

<p>The hyphen characters on the RIGHT ALT layer are used for accessing historic syllables. Type the character followed by a vowel and the historic syllable will be formed. There are not historic syllables for every vowel, so the hyphen may remain in the text unexpectedly).</p>
