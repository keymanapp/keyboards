<p>
    This is a Postmodern English keyboard with a typical United States key layout, 
	and in the "DualStroke" Postmodern English style (as opposed to the Natural 
	style). The Postmodern English project is an open source, community-driven 
	effort to build dictionaries around all the major accents of the English
	language. In itself, Postmodern English is a refactor of how English writing 
	functions, which focuses on making it as phonetic, consistent, and condensed 
	as possible. Though not the first attempt at doing this by any means, we hope 
	that it can become the greatest. For more information on Postmodern English and 
	the related community efforts, please visit

<h3>Usage Instructions For Desktop Keyboard</h3>
<p>
	Compared to the standard American English keyboard, the Postmodern English 
	keyboard functions very similarly with some minor changes.
	<br /><br />
	This is the layout of the Postmodern English DualStroke keyboard. As with the standard 
	American English keyboard, most keys only need one press to print out a character to the 
	screen.
	<br /><br />

	<br /><br />
	Notice that some keys on the keyboard are highlighted in yellow. This indicates that these 
	keys have alternate options when the correct key combinations are pressed. The alternate 
	options are sometimes displayed below the main character in the keyboard image. Yellow 
	colored keys that do not have an alternate option displayed on the key are characters which 
	can be accented.
	<br /><br />
	In order to type any alternate key on screen, one of the three “dead keys” must first be 
	pressed. These keys are highlighted in green in the image above, and will initially do 
	nothing when pressed. However, when a yellow or green key is pressed after a green key, the 
	alternate character will be printed to screen. Which character is printed to screen depends 
	both on the green and yellow keys pressed.
	<br /><br />
	Take notice of the symbols printed on the green 1, 2, and 3 keys. The 1 key has both the 
	acute accent and the “AK” symbols on it, the 2 key has the macron accent printed on it, and 
	the 3 key lastly has the overring accent on it. What this means is that the 1 dead key can be 
	used to start some non-accentable characters in yellow (using AK, standing for alternate key, 
	not to be confused with the ALT key), or any character with an acute accent. Similarly, the 2 
	dead key can be used to start a macron accented character, and the 3 dead key can be used to 
	begin an overring accented character. To just type “1”, “2”, or “3”, the 1, 2, or 3 key 
	respectively will need to be pressed twice in a row. For example, to type the alternate 
	character Ԏ, you would first press the green "AK" key, and then the J key. Or if you wanted 
	to type Ů, you would press the green overring key, followed by the U key. It's that simple.
	<br /><br />
	Typing any alternate characters is easy after some practice. Regardless of capitalization, 
	all of these key combinations work the same way. The following list shows all of the “dead 
	key” combination presses used for alternate characters:
	<br /><br />
	1 + 1 = 1<br />
	2 + 2 = 2<br />
	3 + 3 = 3<br />
	1 + Ћ = Þ<br />
	1 + E = É<br />
	2 + E = Ē<br />
	1 + R = Ԅ<br />
	1 + T = Է<br />
	1 + U = Ú<br />
	2 + U = Ū<br />
	3 + U = Ů<br />
	2 + I = Ī<br />
	1 + O = Ó<br />
	2 + O = Ō<br />
	1 + A = Á<br />
	2 + A = Ā<br />
	3 + A = Å<br />
	1 + J = Ԏ<br />
	1 + N = Ŋ<br />
	1 + Ч = X<br />
	1 + W = Q (Non-Postmodern letter)<br />
	1 + Ҁ = C (Non-Postmodern letter)<br />

<h3>Usage Instructions For Mobile Keyboard</h3>
<p>
	The Postmodern English mobile keyboard is very easy to use. Each key you see only requires
	one key press to type the character shown on it. For keys that have a small dot in the top 
	right corners, you can press and hold for a moment to open a popup that will allow you to 
	select different characters organized under that character. For example, by pressing and 
	holding the letter "T", you can get an option to type the letter "Է". Pressing "123" will 
	bring you to a numbers and symbols keyboard. On the numbers and symbols keyboard, a new 
	key labeled "Núm" will appear. Pressing this key will bring you to a number pad, much 
	like you'd see on an ATM machine. The final button worth mentioning on the main keyboard, 
	the "smiley face" button, will bring you to the emoji selection keyboard. Here's what the 
	mobile keyboard looks like:
