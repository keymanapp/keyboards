  "description": "This is an American English keyboard designed for typing in Postmodern English, in the DualStroke layout style. The Postmodern English Project is an open source, community led effort to create dictionaries of Postmodern English words from around the world. Postmodern English in itself is a refactor of how English writing functions, which focuses on making it as phonetic, consistent, and condensed as possible. For more information, please visit the Postmodern English website linked below.\n<ul>\n  <li><a href='http://www.postmodernenglish.org'>Postmodern English Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n"
