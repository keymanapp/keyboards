The Postmodern English Project is an open source, community led effort to create dictionaries of Postmodern English words from around the world. Postmodern English in itself is a refactor of how English writing functions, which focuses on making it as phonetic, consistent, and condensed as possible. For more information, please visit the Postmodern English website linked below."
