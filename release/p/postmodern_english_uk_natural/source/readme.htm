<h1>Postmodern English UK Natural Layout</h1>

<p>
	This is a Postmodern English keyboard with a typical United Kingdom key layout, 
	and in the "Natural" Postmodern English style (as opposed to the DualStroke 
	style). The Postmodern English project is an open source, community-driven 
	effort to build dictionaries around all the major accents of the English
	language. In itself, Postmodern English is a refactor of how English writing 
	functions, which focuses on making it as phonetic, consistent, and condensed 
	as possible. Though not the first attempt at doing this by any means, we hope 
	that it can become the greatest. For more information on Postmodern English and 
	the related community efforts, please visit
