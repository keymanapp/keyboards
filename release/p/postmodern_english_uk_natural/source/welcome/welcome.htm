<h1>Start Using the Postmodern English UK Natural Layout</h1>

<p>
    This is a Postmodern English keyboard with a typical United Kingdom key layout, 
	and in the "Natural" Postmodern English style (as opposed to the DualStroke 
	style). The Postmodern English project is an open source, community-driven 
	effort to build dictionaries around all the major accents of the English
	language. In itself, Postmodern English is a refactor of how English writing 
	functions, which focuses on making it as phonetic, consistent, and condensed 
	as possible. Though not the first attempt at doing this by any means, we hope 
	that it can become the greatest. For more information on Postmodern English and 
	the related community efforts, please visit

<h3>Usage Instructions For Desktop Keyboard</h3>
<p>
	Compared to the standard British English keyboard, the Postmodern English 
	keyboard functions very similarly with some minor changes.
	<br /><br />
	This is the layout of the Postmodern English Natural keyboard. As with the 
	standard British English keyboard, most keys only need one press to print 
	out a character to the screen.
	<br /><br />
	<img src = "pme_uk_natural_desktop_keyboard.png" alt = "Postmodern English UK Natural Style Desktop">
	<br /><br />
	Notice that some keys on the keyboard are highlighted in yellow. This indicates 
	that these keys have alternate options when the correct key combinations are pressed. 
	The alternate options are displayed below the main character in the keyboard image.
	<br /><br />
	In order to type any alternate character on screen, the “dead key” must first be pressed. 
	This key is highlighted in green in the image above, and will initially do nothing when 
	pressed. However, when a yellow or green key is pressed after the green key, the alternate 
	character will be printed to screen. Which character is printed to screen depends both on 
	the green and yellow keys pressed.
	<br /><br />
	Take notice of the symbols printed on the green “;” key: a semicolon and “DK”. This “DK” 
	means that this key can be used to type the character below the main character for any key, 
	by first pressing the green “DK” key, and then any yellow key. So for example, if you want 
	to type Ԅ, which is below the R key, you would first press the green “DK” key, and then 
	press the R key to type out an Ԅ. To just type a semicolon, press the “DK” key two times 
	in a row. It’s that simple.
	<br /><br />
	Typing any alternate characters is easy after some practice. Regardless of capitalization, 
	all of these key combinations work the same way. The following list shows all of the “dead 
	key” combination presses used for alternate characters:
	<br /><br />
	; + ; = ;<br />
	; + Ћ = Þ<br />
	; + R = Ԅ<br />
	; + T = Է<br />
	; + J = Ԏ<br />
	; + N = Ŋ<br />
	; + Ч = X<br />
	; + Á = !<br />
	; + Ā = "<br />
	; + Å = £<br />
	; + É = $<br />
	; + Ē = %<br />
	; + Ú = ^<br />
	; + Ū = & <br />
	; + Ů = *<br />
	; + Ī = (<br />
	; + Ó = )<br />
	; + Ō = _<br />
	; + W = Q (non-Postmodern letter)<br />
	; + Ҁ = C (non-Postmodern letter)<br />
	<br /><br />
	Don’t want to press the dead key each time you need to type a number or symbol from the top 
	row of keys? There’s an easier way! The Right Alt key can be held down, and then the top row 
	of keys can be used to type numbers and symbols with just one keystroke. In a similar manner, 
	the Right Alt key + the Shift key can be held down together to type symbols from the top row 
	of keys that would normally be accessed with the shift key on standard keyboard layouts. Here 
	are all the Right Alt key combinations that can be used:
	<br /><br />
	Right Alt + Á = 1<br />
	Right Alt + Ā = 2<br />
	Right Alt + Å = 3<br />
	Right Alt + É = 4<br />
	Right Alt + Ē = 5<br />
	Right Alt + Ú = 6<br />
	Right Alt + Ū = 7<br />
	Right Alt + Ů = 8<br />
	Right Alt + Ī = 9<br />
	Right Alt + Ó = 0<br />
	Right Alt + Ō = -<br />
	Right Alt + Ћ = ¦<br />
	Right Alt + E = €<br />
	Right Alt + Shift + Á = !<br />
	Right Alt + Shift + Ā = “<br />
	Right Alt + Shift + Å = £<br />
	Right Alt + Shift + É = $<br />
	Right Alt + Shift + Ē = %<br />
	Right Alt + Shift + Ú = ^<br />
	Right Alt + Shift + Ū = & <br />
	Right Alt + Shift + Ů = *<br />
	Right Alt + Shift + Ī = (<br />
	Right Alt + Shift + Ó = )<br />
	Right Alt + Shift + Ō = _<br />

<h3>Usage Instructions For Mobile Keyboard</h3>
<p>
	The Postmodern English mobile keyboard is very easy to use. Each key you see only requires
	one key press to type the character shown on it. For keys that have a small dot in the top 
	right corners, you can press and hold for a moment to open a popup that will allow you to 
	select different characters organized under that character. For example, by pressing and 
	holding the letter "T", you can get an option to type the letter "Է". Pressing "123" will 
	bring you to a numbers and symbols keyboard. On the numbers and symbols keyboard, a new 
	key labeled "Núm" will appear. Pressing this key will bring you to a number pad, much 
	like you'd see on an ATM machine. The final button worth mentioning on the main keyboard, 
	the "smiley face" button, will bring you to the emoji selection keyboard. Here's what the 
	mobile keyboard looks like:
