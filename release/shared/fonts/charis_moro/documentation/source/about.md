## About this project

This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for all current languages and writing systems that use Latin and Cyrillic scripts. It supports almost the complete range of Unicode characters for these scripts, including a comprehensive range of diacritics and a large set of symbols useful for linguistics and literacy work. Smart font routines automatically adjust the position of diacritics to support and optimize arbitrary base+diacritic combinations. 

For more information on the visual characteristics of the font family see [Design](design.md).

For a comparison between this and other SIL fonts, see [Comparison of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic fonts](https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/support/comparison/).

## Future plans

These fonts are actively maintained and improved, and recent changes to their development process will enable more frequent releases.

The highest priorities for future additions and enhancements are mainly driven by:

- New additions to [The Unicode Standard](https://unicode.org/)
- Requests from language communities using the fonts
- Needs of the linguistic and academic community

Although some expert typographic features are supported (e.g. small caps), those are a lesser priority.

Please send us your requests using the [form on the font website](https://software.sil.org/charis/about/contact/). If you are interested in helping us make the fonts better, see the [Developer](developer.md) page.

## Supporting the project

These fonts are provided at no cost; however, they are expensive to produce and maintain. Please consider donating to SIL’s font development efforts to support future development. Go to [SIL’s Give Direct page](https://give.sil.org/give/485238). **Thank you!**
