Charis is optimized for readability in long printed documents. It is highly readable and holds up well in less-than-ideal reproduction environments due to its simple and robust design with strong serifs and clear features.

### Note regarding Charter

This Charis font is essentially the same design as the SIL Charis font first released by SIL in 1997. The design of the basic character set of Charis is similar (but not identical) to Bitstream Charter, designed by Matthew Carter. The following notice accompanied the Charter fonts:
