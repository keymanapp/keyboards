    <h2 id="about-this-project">About this project</h2>
    <p>This project is intended to provide a free and open font family
    for all current languages and writing systems that use Latin and
    Cyrillic scripts. It supports almost the complete range of Unicode
    characters for these scripts, including a comprehensive range of
    diacritics and a large set of symbols useful for linguistics and
    literacy work. Smart font routines automatically adjust the position
    of diacritics to support and optimize arbitrary base+diacritic
    combinations.</p>
    <p>For more information on the visual characteristics of the font
    family see <a href="design.html">Design</a>.</p>
    <p>For a comparison between this and other SIL fonts, see <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/support/comparison/">Comparison
    of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic fonts</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
    <p>These fonts are actively maintained and improved, and recent
    changes to their development process will enable more frequent
    releases.</p>
    <p>The highest priorities for future additions and enhancements are
    mainly driven by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>New additions to <a href="https://unicode.org/">The Unicode
    Standard</a></li>
    <li>Requests from language communities using the fonts</li>
    <li>Needs of the linguistic and academic community</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although some expert typographic features are supported (e.g.
    small caps), those are a lesser priority.</p>
    <p>Please send us your requests using the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/charis/about/contact/">form on the
    font website</a>. If you are interested in helping us make the fonts
    better, see the <a href="developer.html">Developer</a> page.</p>
