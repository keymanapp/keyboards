for frequently asked questions and their answers.


TIPS
====

We cannot afford to offer free technical support. The font has, however, 
been through some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most
situations. In particular, it has been tested and shown to work on Windows 
XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.

If you do find a problem, please do report it to <fonts AT sil DOT org>.
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in
future versions. Make sure you read through the 
Abyssinica SIL FAQ (https://software.sil.org/abyssinica/support/).

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding:
Abyssinica SIL can be used with any Unicode Ethiopic keyboarding program. 

However, Keyman is a crossplatform keyboarding system and a number of Ethiopic 
keyboards are available:
https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_ethiopic_power_g
https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_ethiopic
https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_blin
https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_geez
https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_amharic
https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_tigrinya_ethiopia
https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_tigrinya_eritrea

Another method of entering some symbols is provided by a few applications
such as Adobe InDesign. They can display a glyph palette that shows all the
glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter them by clicking on the
glyph you want.

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with either of two advanced font technologies, 
Graphite or OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType. See "Applications
that provide an adequate level of support for SIL Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek fonts
(https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/support/application-support/).
