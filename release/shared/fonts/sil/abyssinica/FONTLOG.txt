FONTLOG
Abyssinica SIL font family
========================


This file provides detailed information on the Abyssinica SIL font.
This information should be distributed along with the Abyssinica SIL font and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Abyssinica SIL has a single face - regular. 

The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font 
that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
Ethiopic-based writing system. In addition, there is provision for other 
Latin characters and symbols. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
technologies to support the need to position arbitrary combinations of 
*Ethiopic* base glyphs and combining marks optimally. It also supports
almost 200 kerning pairs. This version of the font also supports Character 
Variants (OpenType) or Features (Graphite) which make glyph alternates 
available for a number of Ethiopic and punctuation characters. See the 
AbyssinicaSILFontFeatures.pdf, for details on applications which support 
Character Variants and how to access them.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Abyssinica SIL Regular 


A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Abyssinica" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of 
Abyssinica SIL. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants 
through this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font
Names in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as 
long as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Abyssinica" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Abyssinica SIL SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Abyssinica" and "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Nations Ethiopic".
