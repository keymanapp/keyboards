Tagmukay font
========================


This file provides detailed information on the Tagmukay family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Tagmukay fonts and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Tagmukay is a Unicode font with smart font capabilities added using 
state-of-the-art font technologies. This means that complex typographic 
issues such as the formation of ligatures are handled by the font, provided you 
are running an application that provides an adequate level of support for one of 
these smart font technologies.

SIL International is the creator of the Tagmukay fonts.


A Note Regarding the Open Font License
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Tagmukay" and "SIL" in the 
name of any font that is derived from the original version of Tagmukay.
