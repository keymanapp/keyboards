# Busra

The Busra fonts provide Unicode support for languages and writing systems that use the Khmer script. The design is based on the Khmer Mondulkiri family of fonts (https://software.sil.org/mondulkiri/), but with significant updates to the design and rendering behavior.

The current version is 9.000. It contains six weights and can be downloaded from the [project releases page](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-busra/releases). There are no oblique (italic) styles in this release. They will be added in a future release.

These fonts are copyright (c) 2003-2025 SIL Global (https://www.sil.org/) and are released under under the [SIL Open Font License (openfontlicense.org)](https://openfontlicense.org).
