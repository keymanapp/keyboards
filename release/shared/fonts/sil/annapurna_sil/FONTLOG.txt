FONTLOG
Annapurna SIL font
========================


This file provides detailed information on the Annapurna SIL family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Annapurna SIL fonts and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Annapurna SIL is a TrueType font with smart font capabilities added using 
state-of-the-art font technologies. This means that complex typographic 
issues such as the placement of combining marks or the formation of ligatures 
are handled by the font, provided you are running an application that provides 
an adequate level of support for one of these smart font technologies.

Annapurna SIL has a calligraphic design that reflects the stroke contrast of 
writing the characters with a broad nib used for Devanagari.

SIL International is the creator of the Annapurna SIL fonts, and is the owner
of all proprietary rights therein.


A Note Regarding the Open Font License
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Annapurna" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Annapurna
SIL.

Information for Contributors
----------------------------

The release of Annapurna SIL version 1.0.0.0 (Version 1.000) (and any subsequent 
versions) under the OFL license provides a means for people to contribute to the 
project. For information on what you're allowed to change or modify, consult the 
OFL and OFL-FAQ. The OFL-FAQ also gives a very general rationale regarding why 
you would want to contribute to the project.

Anyone can make their own modified version of Annapurna SIL (using a different
name), but SIL International will continue to maintain and develop the
canonical version of the Annapurna SIL fonts. As the package maintainer, we
warmly welcome contributions. Here are some things to keep in mind:

Format: We are open to contributions in various formats, but if you want to
maximise the chances of us including your work, please make it available to
us (via email or a URL) as either a FontLab database (preferred) or a
PostScript Type 1 (or OT-CFF) font.

Source files: We are not yet making the source files available, but hope to in 
the future.

Copyright attribution: If you submit something for inclusion in the main
Annapurna SIL fonts, we will ask you to affirm that it is your original work,
and ask you to assign the copyright of your work to SIL International. This
is to ensure that future releases can be made under improved versions of the
OFL without needing to track you down for further permission. This follows
the same principle used by the FSF. Keep in mind that we are a
not-for-profit organization committed to free/libre and open source
software, and that any contributions incorporated in the fonts will always
be available under the OFL or a similar license.

Quality: Because we want to be able to guarantee a high level of quality for
the primary Annapurna SIL fonts, we will review submissions carefully. Please
don't be discouraged if we do not include a submission for this reason, or
ask you to make specific revisions.

Types of contributions: If you wish to make a contribution - a set of
additional glyphs, scripts, code, etc. - please contact us before you do any
work to see if it is a contribution we currently need. Every addition adds
to the complexity of the project and needs to be carefully planned. This
also avoids two people working on the same type of addition at the same time.

Linux packages: Please contact the upstream maintainer of the various 
packages - nicolas.spalinger@sil.org - if you want to help package or 
maintain a package.

When submissions will be included: We plan to revise the fonts when major 
updates are needed (eg new versions of Unicode). If you wish to make 
submissions, contact us on the timing.
