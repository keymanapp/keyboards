FONTLOG 
Lateef font
===========

This file provides detailed information on the Lateef font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Lateef fonts 
and any derivative works.

## Basic Font Information

Lateef is named after Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai, the famous Sindhi 
mystic and poet. It is intended to be an appropriate style for use 
in Sindhi and other languages of the South Asian region.

This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 13.0 Arabic character 
repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not 
recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented using 
state-of-the-art OpenType technology, including variant glyphs for a 
number of characters for use in particular contexts. 

This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic 
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures 
or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This 
simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic 
languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and 
literate communities.

Seven weights for this typeface family are included:

     * Lateef ExtraLight
     * Lateef Light
     * Lateef Regular
     * Lateef Medium
     * Lateef SemiBold
     * Lateef Bold
     * Lateef ExtraBold

The Latin glyphs in this font are from the Crimson Pro font family 
(https://github.com/Fonthausen/CrimsonPro).

For detailed documentation see the contents of the 'documentation' folder.

#### Known issues

- Characters added since LateefGR are not yet kerned so spacing after reh- and 
  waw-like characters may be incorrect. Please let us know of specific combinations
  that should be improved.
- In Word: kerning of Arabic proportional digits is incorrect. This is a bug in Word.
- In InDesign: some behaviors, such as the _lam-alef_ ligature, raised _kasra_ with 
  _shadda_, and subtending marks, will not function correctly unless **Ligatures** is 
  turned on in the **Characters** panel.
