Akatab
======

This file provides detailed information on the Akatab family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Akatab fonts and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Akatab is a TrueType font for the Tifinagh script with smart font capabilities 
added using state-of-the-art font technologies. This means that complex 
typographic issues such as the placement of combining marks or the formation 
of ligatures are handled by the font, provided you are running an application 
that provides an adequate level of support for one of these smart font 
technologies.

The Latin glyphs are based on the OFL-licensed Source Sans Pro fonts
(https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro).
