Akatab
======

Akatab is a Unicode font for rendering Tifinagh characters in the Tamahaq and 
Tamashek languages. This font uses state-of-the-art OpenType and Graphite font 
technologies to provide accurate typography including the formation of 
bi-consonant ligatures. Variations of characters are included in the font to 
meet personal and regional preferences. For more information about supported 
Unicode ranges and languages, smart font features and how to use them, please 
see the documentation folder.

Akatab is released under under the SIL Open Font License 
(http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).  

The Latin glyphs are based on the OFL-licensed Source Sans Pro fonts 
(https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro).

TIPS
====
As this font is distributed at no cost, we are unable to provide a commercial 
level of personal technical support. The font has, however, been through some 
testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most situations. In 
particular, it has been tested and shown to work on Windows 10. Graphite 
capabilities have been tested on Graphite-supported platforms.

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding 
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support 
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet. 
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however, 
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding: 
This font does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. You may use the 
built-in keyboards of the operating system. You may also need to install an 
appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the language you 
wish to use. If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any
system keyboard, the Keyman program (www.keyman.com) can be helpful on 
Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. 

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with two advanced font technologies, Graphite 
and OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of 
this font, you must be using applications that provide an adequate level of 
support for Graphite or OpenType.


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
==============================

If you are not sure how to install the fonts, please consult your operating 
system documentation for instructions on font installation.
