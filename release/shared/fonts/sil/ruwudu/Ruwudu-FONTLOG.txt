Ruwudu font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Ruwudu font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Ruwudu font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Ruwudu is the Manga word for "writing". This style of writing is used by the Manga 
people in Niger, West Africa. This font was initially designed as a lighter or 
companion version of Alkalami Regular (https://software.sil.org/alkalami/). The 
design is still very much influenced by the Rubutun Kano style, but was based on 
samples of footnotes from the market edition manuscripts. These were made with a 
monoline tool, likely a ball point pen or something similar. The extreme swashes 
and tails of Alkalami are replaced by more classic and reserved shapes. 

This font supports the characters known to be used by languages written in this
style of Arabic script, but may not have the characters needed for other
languages.

This font utilizes state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex
typographic issues. Font smarts are implemented using OpenType only. We have
no current plans to support Graphite.

One font is included in this release:
     * Ruwudu Regular
