Subsets
========================

SIL's Non-Roman Script Initiative has created very comprehensive
fonts for Latin, Cyrillic and Greek character sets. Charis SIL, 
Doulos SIL, Gentium Plus and Andika are very large fonts that cover 
just about every need we know about in the Latin and Cyrillic world. 
Gentium Plus also covers Greek. Now, as we move into the age of 
mobile phone and web usage, there is a need for fonts that are 
small and compact. Our fonts are over a megabyte each and that is 
considered much too large for mobile phone usage.

Current commercial font subsetting schemes remove the smart font
information from a font when subsetting a font. While this may be
acceptable for majority languages, we consider this unacceptable as
so many languages in the world require smart diacritic positioning
above and/or below base characters. We have now created subsets of
our fonts for different regions of the world. These fonts currently
contain both OpenType and Graphite smart code. Each regional font
only contains the characters (and glyphs) that are known to be used
in that region of the world. We have attempted to use the most
common glyphs required for that region.

Our font subset packages also contain .woff versions of our fonts.
These are especially useful in the context of mobile phone and web
usage.
