FONTLOG
Gentium Plus
============

This file provides detailed information on the Gentium Plus family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Gentium Plus fonts and
any derivative works.

## About this project

Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family 
designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use 
the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The 
design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually 
attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface 
Design" in two major international typeface design competitions: 
bukva:raz! (2001), TDC2003 (2003). The Gentium Plus font family is based on
this original design.

This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for all
current languages and writing systems that use Latin and Cyrillic scripts.
It supports almost the complete range of Unicode characters for these scripts,
including a comprehensive range of diacritics and a large set of symbols
useful for linguistics and literacy work. Smart font routines automatically
adjust the position of diacritics to support and optimize arbitrary
base+diacritic combinations.

## A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Gentium" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Gentium.
However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Gentium", "Gentium Plus", or "Gentium Basic" is not the resulting font
family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Gentium Plus Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Gentium" and "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Grace Foo".

## ChangeLog

(This should list both major and minor changes, most recent first.)

### 2 July 2021 (SIL WSTech Team) Gentium Plus version 6.001

- Reverted font Postscript name to that used in v5 and earlier to avoid problems with unrecognized fonts when opening older documents.

### 29 Jun 2021 (SIL WSTech Team) Gentium Plus version 6.000

***Note that this is a major upgrade that may cause document reflow as some glyphs widths have changed and some features have been removed.***

#### Removed

- **Removed DSIGs added in version 5.000.** These have now been removed to reflect current best practice font development guidance. Adobe InDesign will complain that fonts cannot be found if a document last saved with version 5.000 is opened with version 5.960 or later installed. It will be necessary to find/replace the fonts in the document using the command in the Type menu. Please also look over the document carefully to note any places where changes in the fonts have affected letterforms or spacing.

- **Graphite has been removed.** Application and OS support for OpenType has greatly improved, so the need for Graphite in this font family is greatly reduced. *If this affects you, and you find that OpenType does not provide sufficient support for your needs, please contact us right away.*  

- Removed the *Show Invisibles* feature.

- Removed support for nine-level pitch contours. These will be replaced by a standalone pitch contours font in the future.

- Applied new hinting techniques to try to improve screen rendering on Windows

#### Fixes

- Improved miscellaneous anchor positions, including the position of diacritics 
below glyphs with macrons below (e.g. U+1E0F LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH LINE BELOW)

- Improved position of diacritics for superscripts and modifier letters

#### Known issues

- The low-profile diacritics feature (ss07) is present but not working properly in some cases.

- There is no support for TypeTuner or TypeTuner Web. We hope to add that support soon.

- There are no regional subsets. Please contact us if these are a priority for you and describe how you use them. We are reassessing whether to provide these subsets. With current web technology and WOFF2 compression most uses can be met equally well with the full fonts.
