Basic Font Information

Kay Pho Du is a font for the Kayah Li script, based initially on the design
of [Karenni](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-karenni), although the glyphs
have been redrawn and a new Latin set has been added. It supports the full
Kayah Li range of Unicode characters (U+A900..U+A92F).
