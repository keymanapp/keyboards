Andika
======

This file provides detailed information on the Andika family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Andika fonts and
any derivative works.

## About this project

Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font
designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms
that will not be easily confused with one another.

A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching
people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than some
serif fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to make do
with fonts that were available but not really suitable for beginning
readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to
tediously cobble together letters from a variety of fonts in order to
get the all of characters they need for their particular language
project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika
addresses those issues.

## A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Andika" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Andika.
However, SIL Global (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Andika" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Andika Non-Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Andika" or "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like 
"Write Sans".

## ChangeLog

(This should list both major and minor changes, most recent first.)

### 2 Jun 2025 (SIL WSTech Team) Andika version 7.000

***Note that this is a major upgrade with significant changes to family structure and glyph metrics. Please read the following carefully to understand how the changes may affect you.***

#### Family structure

- There are additional intermediate weights. Previously existing weights in both families have not changed. Here is a list, with retained weights in **bold** and new weights in *italic*. The CSS values for the weights within each family are in parentheses. Italic faces follow a similar structure and correspondence.

    - **Andika Regular** (400)
    - *Andika Medium* (500)
    - *Andika SemiBold* (600)
    - **Andika Bold** (700)

- There are no *Compact* variants. *Compact* versions of the v6.2 fonts remain available from https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/

- TypeTuner Web no longer offers line spacing alternatives for the v7 fonts (Normal, Tight, Loose). If you need Tight or Loose variants the v6.2 fonts remain available and support line spacing alternatives.

- There are no ‘pre-tuned’ regional or special-purpose modified variants. The v6.2 variants remain available from https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/. You can still manually create v7 variants with TypeTuner Web.

#### New features and enhancements

- Kerning has now been added and covers the full range of alphabetic symbols except for small caps (which will be included in a future update). **Warning: Because of the addition of extensive kerning, line, paragraph, and page lengths may be different from v6.2.** If this affects you the [Andika Six font family](https://software.sil.org/andika/andika-six-release-6-210-a-renamed-version-of-andika-6-200/) may be helpful.

- The default form for capital N with left hook has been changed to the lowercase style to match the capital Eng. The related feature (`cv44`) has been changed to substitute the uppercase style form.
    - U+019D LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH LEFT HOOK

- The OpenType feature for alternate versions of 6 and 9 with diagonal stems has been split into two separate features. The previously existing feature (`cv06`) now only affects the numeral 6. A new feature (`cv09`) affects only the numeral 9.

- New Opentype feature added to remove bars on capital I (`cv30`)

- Additions to Modifier Apostrophe feature (`cv70`)

### 2 July 2021 (SIL WSTech Team) Andika version 6.001

- Reverted font Postscript name to that used in v5 and earlier to avoid problems with unrecognized fonts when opening older documents.

### 29 Jun 2021 (SIL WSTech Team) Andika version 6.000

***Note that this is a major upgrade that may cause document reflow as some glyphs widths have changed and some features have been removed.***

#### Removed

- **Removed DSIGs added in version 5.000.** These have now been removed to reflect current best practice font development guidance. Adobe InDesign will complain that fonts cannot be found if a document last saved with version 5.000 is opened with version 5.960 or later installed. It will be necessary to find/replace the fonts in the document using the command in the Type menu. Please also look over the document carefully to note any places where changes in the fonts have affected letterforms or spacing.

- **Graphite has been removed.** Application and OS support for OpenType has greatly improved, so the need for Graphite in this font family is greatly reduced. *If this affects you, and you find that OpenType does not provide sufficient support for your needs, please contact us right away.*  

- Removed the *Show Invisibles* feature.

- Removed support for nine-level pitch contours. These will be replaced by a standalone pitch contours font in the future.

#### Added
