Andika
======

This file provides detailed information on the Andika family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Andika fonts and
any derivative works.

## About this project

Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font
designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms
that will not be easily confused with one another.

A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching
people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than some
serif fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to make do
with fonts that were available but not really suitable for beginning
readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to
tediously cobble together letters from a variety of fonts in order to
get the all of characters they need for their particular language
project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika
addresses those issues.

## A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Andika" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Andika.
However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Andika" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Andika Non-Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Andika" or "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like 
"Write Sans".

### 2 July 2021 (SIL WSTech Team) Andika version 6.001

- Reverted font Postscript name to that used in v5 and earlier to avoid problems with unrecognized fonts when opening older documents.

### 29 Jun 2021 (SIL WSTech Team) Andika version 6.000

***Note that this is a major upgrade that may cause document reflow as some glyphs widths have changed and some features have been removed.***

#### Removed

- **Removed DSIGs added in version 5.000.** These have now been removed to reflect current best practice font development guidance. Adobe InDesign will complain that fonts cannot be found if a document last saved with version 5.000 is opened with version 5.960 or later installed. It will be necessary to find/replace the fonts in the document using the command in the Type menu. Please also look over the document carefully to note any places where changes in the fonts have affected letterforms or spacing.

- **Graphite has been removed.** Application and OS support for OpenType has greatly improved, so the need for Graphite in this font family is greatly reduced. *If this affects you, and you find that OpenType does not provide sufficient support for your needs, please contact us right away.*  

- Removed the *Show Invisibles* feature.

- Removed support for nine-level pitch contours. These will be replaced by a standalone pitch contours font in the future.
