FONTLOG
Charis SIL
==========

This file provides detailed information on the Charis SIL family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Charis SIL fonts and
any derivative works.

## About this project

This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for all
current languages and writing systems that use Latin and Cyrillic scripts.
It supports almost the complete range of Unicode characters for these scripts,
including a comprehensive range of diacritics and a large set of symbols
useful for linguistics and literacy work. Smart font routines automatically
adjust the position of diacritics to support and optimize arbitrary
base+diacritic combinations.

Charis SIL is optimized for readability in long printed documents. It is
highly readable and holds up well in less-than-ideal reproduction environments
due to its simple and robust design with strong serifs and clear features.

## Note regarding Charter

This Charis SIL font is essentially the same design as the SIL Charis font
first released by SIL in 1997. The design of the basic character set of Charis 
IL is similar (but not identical) to Bitstream Charter, designed by Matthew
Carter. The following notice accompanied the Charter fonts: 

> © Copyright 1989-1992, Bitstream Inc., Cambridge, MA. 
>
> You are hereby granted permission under all Bitstream propriety rights to
> use, copy, modify, sublicense, sell, and redistribute the 4 Bitstream
> Charter® Type 1 outline fonts and the 4 Courier Type 1 outline fonts for
> any purpose and without restriction; provided, that this notice is left
> intact on all copies of such fonts and that Bitstream's trademark is
> acknowledged as shown below on all unmodified copies of the 4 Charter Type
> 1 fonts. 
>
> BITSTREAM CHARTER is a registered trademark of Bitstream Inc.

SIL International is the creator of the Charis SIL fonts, and is the owner
of all proprietary rights therein.

## A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Charis" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Charis
SIL. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Charis SIL" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Charis SIL Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Charis" and "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Grace Foo".

### 2 July 2021 (SIL WSTech Team) Charis SIL version 6.001

- Reverted font Postscript name to that used in v5 and earlier to avoid
problems with unrecognized fonts when opening older documents.

### 29 Jun 2021 (SIL WSTech Team) Charis SIL version 6.000

***Note that this is a major upgrade that may cause document reflow as
some glyphs widths have changed and some features have been removed.***

#### Removed

- **Removed DSIGs added in version 5.000.** These have now been removed
to reflect current best practice font development guidance. Adobe InDesign
will complain that fonts cannot be found if a document last saved with
version 5.000 is opened with version 5.960 or later installed. It will be
necessary to find/replace the fonts in the document using the command in
the Type menu. Please also look over the document carefully to note any
places where changes in the fonts have affected letterforms or spacing.

- **Graphite has been removed.** Application and OS support for OpenType
has greatly improved, so the need for Graphite in this font family is
greatly reduced. *If this affects you, and you find that OpenType does 
not provide sufficient support for your needs, please contact us right
away.*  

- Removed the "Show Invisibles" feature.

- Removed support for nine-level pitch contours. These will be replaced
by a standalone pitch contours font in the future.

#### Added
