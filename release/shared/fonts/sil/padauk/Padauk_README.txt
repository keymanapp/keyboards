This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for all languages and writing systems that use the Myanmar (Burmese) script.
It supports the complete range of Unicode characters for the script and works on OpenType based systems.
For details about the language and alternate character support see [Font features](https://software.sil.org/padauk/smart-font-features/).
This project uses a UFO-based design and production workflow, with all sources in open formats and a completely open-source build toolkit.
