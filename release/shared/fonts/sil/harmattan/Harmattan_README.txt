Harmattan
========================

Thank you for your interest in the Harmattan font.
We hope you find it useful!

The Harmattan font contains near complete coverage of all the characters 
defined in Unicode 13.0 for Arabic script (excluding the Arabic Presentation 
Forms blocks, which are not recommended for normal use). We include full
support for the Arabic and Arabic Supplement blocks. Harmattan also includes support
for the Arabic Extended-A block with the exception of U+08D3..U+08E2.  

This font uses state-of-the-art OpenType and Graphite font technologies, 
including variant glyphs for a number of characters for use in particular 
contexts.  

Harmattan is released under the SIL Open Font License.
Harmattan is a trademark of SIL International.
	
See the OFL and OFL-FAQ for details of the SIL Open Font License.
See the FONTLOG for information on this and previous releases.

For further information about this font, including Unicode ranges
supported, Graphite and OpenType font features and how to use them, 
and licensing, please see the documentation on the website 
(http://software.sil.org/harmattan/) or in the documentation 
subfolder of this font package.

KNOWN ISSUES
============
At the time of the Harmattan 2.000 release there is a known issue for printing
with Harmattan in Word 2019 and Word 365. Printing to a printer or to pdf may 
cause a reh-like glyph to shift in its advanced width. The result is that there
appears to be a small space between the preceding character and the reh-like
character. Microsoft is working on releasing an update that includes a fix for 
this issue. Once Microsoft releases the update, the solution to this issue will 
be to update Microsoft Office. You can do this by opening a document in Word 
and go to File > Account > Update Options > Update Now.

TIPS
====

As this font is distributed at no cost, we are unable to provide a 
commercial level of personal technical support. The font has, however, 
been through some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most
situations. In particular, it has been tested and shown to work on Windows 10. 
Graphite capabilities have been tested on Graphite-supported platforms.

If you do find a problem, please do report it through 
https://software.sil.org/harmattan/support/. We can't guarantee any direct 
response, but will try to fix reported bugs in future versions. 

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters. Most Windows applications provide 
basic Unicode support. For Arabic text, your application must be able to
handle Right to Left text as well as the initial, medial, final forms of each
Arabic letter. You will also need some way of entering Unicode text into your 
document.

Keyboarding:
This font does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. You may use the
built-in keyboards of the operating system. You may also need to install an
appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the language you
wish to use. If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any
system keyboard, the Keyman program (www.keyman.com) can be helpful
on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. 

If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any system
keyboard, and to access the full Unicode range, you might try charmap.exe
on Windows or, on Ubuntu or similar software, gucharmap or kcharselect.

Another method of entering some symbols is provided by a few applications such
as Adobe InDesign or LibreOffice.org. They can display a glyph palette or input
dialog that shows all the glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter
them by clicking on the glyph you want.

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with any of two advanced font technologies, 
Graphite or OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType.
