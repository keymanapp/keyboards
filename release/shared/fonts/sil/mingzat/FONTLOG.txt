Mingzat
========================

This file provides detailed information on the Mingzat font.
This information should be distributed along with the Mingzat font and
any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Mingzat is based on Jason Glavy's JG Lepcha font which was a custom-encoded
font. We have used his design with his generous permission. He also agreed 
to allow the font to be released under the SIL Open Font License (OFL). 

The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font 
that would contain all Lepcha characters. In addition, there is provision 
for other Latin characters and symbols. This font makes use of 
state-of-the-art font technologies (Graphite and OpenType) to support the 
need for conjuncts and to position arbitrary combinations of Lepcha glyphs 
and combining marks optimally. 

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Mingzat Regular
