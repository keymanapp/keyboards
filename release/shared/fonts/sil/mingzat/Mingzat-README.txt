TIPS
====

As this font is distributed at no cost, we are unable to provide a 
commercial level of personal technical support. The font has, however, 
been through some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most
situations. In particular, it has been tested and shown to work on 
Windows 7. Graphite capabilities have been tested 
on Graphite-supported platforms.

If you do find a problem, please do report it to fonts@sil.org.
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in
future versions. 

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The font is encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding:
This font can be used with any Unicode Lepcha keyboarding program. 

However, Keyman is a crossplatform keyboarding system and one Lepcha 
keyboard is available:

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with Graphite or Opentype advanced font 
technologies. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType. 

Lepcha is a complex Indic script which requires reordering. At this time, 
there is little (or no) support for the Lepcha script in commercial rendering 
systems. Thus, there are only a few applications which can adequately
render Lepcha. Please see the Mingzat webpage (http://software.sil.org/mingzat)
for information on which applications can be used with the Mingzat font.
