Shimenkan

The Shimenkan family of fonts supports the broad variety of writing systems that use the Miao (Pollard) script. Eight language-specific font families are part of the project, each reflecting the particular preferences of that language community.

- Salaowu - for Wuding-Luquan Yi / Hei Yi / Nasu [ywqa]
- Sapushan - for Large Flowery Miao / Dahua Miao / A-Hmao [hmd]
- Shimenkan Guifan - alternate for Large Flowery Miao using the Normalised Miao orthography [hmdd]
- Shimenkan GSM - for Gepo / Bai Yi [ygp]
- Shimenkan MAS - for Small Flowery Miao / Xiaohua Miao [sfm]
- Shimenkan MGS - for Sinicized Miao / Waishu Miao / Hmong Shua [hmz] 
- Shimenkan Zonghe - for Aluo / Gan Yi [yna]
- Taogu - for Lipo / Dong Lisu [lpo]

The Latin glyphs are based on the OFL-licensed Source Sans Pro fonts (https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro). The Miao glyphs are designed to harmonize with the Latin, but remain true to the unique characteristics of Miao writing systems. The project is inspired by, but not based on, the Miao Unicode project (https://github.com/phjamr/MiaoUnicode).
