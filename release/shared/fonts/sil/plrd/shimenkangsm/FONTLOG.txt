FONTLOG
Shimenkan
==========================

This file provides detailed information on the Shimenkan family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Shimenkan fonts and
any derivative works.

The Shimenkan family of fonts supports the broad variety of writing systems
that use the Miao (Pollard) script.

The Latin glyphs are based on the OFL-licensed Source Sans Pro fonts
(https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro). The Miao glyphs are
designed to harmonize with the Latin, but remain true to the unique
characteristics of Miao writing systems. The project is inspired by,
but not based on, the Miao Unicode project
(https://github.com/phjamr/MiaoUnicode).

For copyright and licensing information - including any Reserved Font
Names - see OFL.txt.

For practical information about using, modifying and redistributing this
font see OFL-FAQ.txt.
