FONTLOG
Doulos SIL font family
========================


This file provides detailed information on the Doulos SIL font.
This information should be distributed along with the Doulos SIL font and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Doulos is very similar to Times/Times New Roman, but only has a single 
face - regular. It is intended for use alongside other Times-like fonts where 
a range of styles (italic, bold) are not needed.

The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font family
that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and
symbols useful to linguists. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
technologies to support complex typographic issues, such as the need to
position arbitrary combinations of base glyphs and diacritics optimally.

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Doulos SIL Regular 


A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Doulos" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Doulos
SIL. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Doulos SIL" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Doulos SIL Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Doulos" and "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Servant Foo".

Information for Contributors
----------------------------

The release of Doulos SIL version 4.0.14 (Version 4.014) (and any subsequent 
versions) under the OFL license provides a means for people to modify the fonts
to meet their needs and contribute to the project. For information on what
you're allowed to change or modify, consult the OFL and OFL-FAQ.

Anyone can make their own modified version of Doulos SIL (using a different
name), but SIL International will continue to maintain and develop the
canonical version of the Doulos SIL font. As the package maintainer, we
welcome contributions. Here are some things to keep in mind:

Format: We are open to contributions in various formats, but if you want to
maximise the chances of us including your work, please make it available to
us (via email or a URL) as either a FontLab database (preferred) or a
PostScript Type 1 (or OT-CFF) font.

Source files: We are not yet making the extended source files available, because
our build system is rather complex and difficult to reproduce. We hope to 
include an easier process in the future.

Copyright attribution: If you submit something for inclusion in the main
Doulos SIL fonts, we will ask you to affirm that it is your original work,
and ask you to assign the copyright of your work to SIL International. This
is to ensure that future releases can be made under improved versions of the
OFL without needing to track you down for further permission. This follows
the same principle used by the FSF. Keep in mind that we are a
not-for-profit organization committed to free/libre and open source
software, and that any contributions incorporated in the fonts will always
be available under the OFL or a similar license.

Quality: Because we want to be able to guarantee a high level of quality for
the primary Doulos SIL font, we will review submissions carefully. Please
don't be discouraged if we do not include a submission for this reason, or
ask you to make specific revisions.

Types of contributions: If you wish to make a contribution - a set of
additional glyphs, scripts, code, etc. - please contact us before you do any
work to see if it is a contribution we currently need. Every addition adds
to the complexity of the project and needs to be carefully planned. This
also avoids two people working on the same type of addition at the same time.

Linux packages: Please contact the upstream maintainer of the various 
packages - nicolas_spalinger@sil.org - if you want to help package or 
maintain a package.

When submissions will be included: We plan to revise the fonts when major 
updates are needed (eg new versions of Unicode). If you wish to make 
submissions, contact us on the timing.
