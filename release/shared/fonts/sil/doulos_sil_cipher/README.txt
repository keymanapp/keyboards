Doulos SIL Cipher Release 1.020
========================

Thank you for your interest in the Doulos SIL Cipher font.
We hope you find it useful!

The Cipher music notation is used throughout Indonesia and China
for all kinds of music. The font is not intended for general 
orthographic use. This solution is primarily intended for fairly 
straightforward songbooks for singers, not for complex instrumental 
music. It can handle harmony lines fine, but not a lot of intricacies 
or subtleties (e.g. no staccato).

If you use this font for developing songbooks and you have suggestions 
for improvements we would like to hear back from you. Contact information 
is below.

Doulos SIL Cipher provides glyphs for a minimal range of Latin characters.
Please read the documentation on the website
(http://scripts.sil.org/CipherMusic) to see what ranges are supported. It also
provides additional glyphs required for Cipher Music Notation. 

Doulos SIL Cipher is released under the SIL Open Font License.

TIPS
====

As this font is distributed at no cost, we are unable to provide a 
commercial level of personal technical support. The font has been minimally
tested on Windows 7. Graphite capabilities have been tested on
Graphite-supported platforms.

If you do find a problem, please do report it to fonts@sil.org.
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in
future versions. 

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding:
There is Cipher Music keyboard available on Windows using InKey. For
developing your own keyboard, the Keyman program (www.tavultesoft.com) can be helpful
on Windows systems. Also available for Windows is MSKLC 
(http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx). 
For other platforms, KMFL (http://kmfl.sourceforge.net/), 
XKB (http://www.x.org/wiki/XKB) or Ukelele (http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele) 
can be helpful.

Another method of entering some symbols is provided by a few applications such
as Adobe InDesign or OpenOffice.org. They can display a glyph palette or input
dialog that shows all the glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter
them by clicking on the glyph you want.

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with two advanced font technologies, 
Graphite and OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType. The slurs are currently only
supported through Graphite, not OpenType. If you do not require slurs, then the
bars, dots and slashes should display properly in many OpenType applications.
See the Doulos SIL Cipher page (http://scripts.sil.org/CipherMusic) for a 
complete list of known applications that it will work with.
