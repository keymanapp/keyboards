FONTLOG
Doulos SIL Cipher font family
========================


This file provides detailed information on the Doulos SIL Cipher font.
This information should be distributed along with the Doulos SIL Cipher font
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Doulos is very similar to Times/Times New Roman, but only has a single 
face - regular. It is intended for use alongside other Times-like fonts where 
a range of styles (italic, bold) are not needed.

The goal for this product was to take a subset of the Doulos SIL font and provide
basic non-complex orthographic support for Indonesia PLUS add support for the
Indonesian Kepatihan and Chinese Jianpu Cipher Music Notation. Primary emphasis
has been on Indonesian Kepatihan although we have attempted to include support
for Chinese Jianpu. 

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * Doulos SIL Cipher Regular

Information for Contributors
----------------------------

The primary contributions we would like at this point is feedback on the
Cipher behavior in the font and if any additional features or glyphs are
required to support the Cipher Notation for Indonesian Ketapihan or 
Chinese Jianpu.

The release of Doulos SIL Cipher version 0.220 (and any subsequent 
versions) under the OFL license provides a means for people to modify the fonts
to meet their needs and contribute to the project. For information on what
you're allowed to change or modify, consult the OFL and OFL-FAQ.

Anyone can make their own modified version of Doulos SIL Cipher (using a different
name), but SIL International will continue to maintain and develop the
canonical version of the Doulos SIL Cipher font. As the package maintainer, we
welcome contributions. Here are some things to keep in mind:

Format: We are open to contributions in various formats, but if you want to
maximise the chances of us including your work, please make it available to
us (via email or a URL) as either a FontLab database (preferred) or a
PostScript Type 1 (or OT-CFF) font.

Source files: We are not yet making the extended source files available, because
our build system is rather complex and difficult to reproduce. We hope to 
include an easier process in the future.

Copyright attribution: If you submit something for inclusion in the 
Doulos SIL Cipher font, we will ask you to affirm that it is your original work,
and ask you to assign the copyright of your work to SIL International. This
is to ensure that future releases can be made under improved versions of the
OFL without needing to track you down for further permission. This follows
the same principle used by the FSF. Keep in mind that we are a
not-for-profit organization committed to free/libre and open source
software, and that any contributions incorporated in the fonts will always
be available under the OFL or a similar license.

Quality: Because we want to be able to guarantee a high level of quality for
the primary Doulos SIL Cipher font, we will review submissions carefully. Please
don't be discouraged if we do not include a submission for this reason, or
ask you to make specific revisions.

Types of contributions: If you wish to make a contribution - a set of
additional glyphs, scripts, code, etc. - please contact us before you do any
work to see if it is a contribution we currently need. Every addition adds
to the complexity of the project and needs to be carefully planned. This
also avoids two people working on the same type of addition at the same time.

Linux packages: Please contact the upstream maintainer of the various 
packages - nicolas_spalinger@sil.org - if you want to help package or 
maintain a package.

When submissions will be included: We plan to revise the font on a fairly
regular basis until we know the font is meeting the needs of Cipher Music
Notation users. If you wish to make submissions, contact us on the timing.
