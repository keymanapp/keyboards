FONTLOG 
Scheherazade New font
=================

This file provides detailed information on the Scheherazade font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Scheherazade fonts 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Scheherazade New, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights tale, 
is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as Monotype Naskh, 
extended to cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire.

The goal for this product is to provide a single Unicode-based font family
that contains a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
Arabic-based writing system. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
technologies to support complex typographic issues. 

This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic 
connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures 
or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This 
simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic 
languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and 
literate communities.

Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:

     * Scheherazade New Regular
     * Scheherazade New Bold

This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 13.0 Arabic character 
repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not 
recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented using OpenType 
and Graphite technologies.

For detailed documentation see the contents of the 'documentation' folder.

A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Scheherazade" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of 
Scheherazade. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants 
through this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font
Names in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as 
long as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Scheherazade" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Scheherazade SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Scheherazade" and "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Nations Naskh".
