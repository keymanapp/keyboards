Galatia SIL font family
========================


This file provides detailed information on the Galatia SIL family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Galatia SIL fonts and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

The Galatia SIL fonts contain most of the symbols defined in Unicode
3.1 for Latin-1, Greek (excluding Coptic), Macintosh Character Set (US
Roman), and 850WE/Latin-1 and are supplied in Regular and Bold
weights.


Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:

     * Galatia SIL Regular
     * Galatia SIL Bold

There are no OpenType tables in this font. Thus, there is no automatic
formation of the final sigma.

ChangeLog
---------
(This should list both major and minor changes, most recent first.)

- rereleased with fixed Mac license string

12 June 2009 Version 2.1 OFL release of Galatia SIL.
- released under OFL
- 'vdmx' table recalculated because of errors in the font
  causing some Java[tm] applications on some Windows machines to 
  not display glyphs in Galatia SIL

30 June 2005 Version 2.0.1

- 'hhea' table of the two TrueType fonts has been modified, 
  because an error in the metrics specified there could cause 
  some software, particularly some packages running on Linux, 
  to crash or otherwise perform incorrectly.
