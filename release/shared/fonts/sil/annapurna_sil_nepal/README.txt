This package contains a TypeTuned version of the Annapurna SIL fonts.

in the package as feat_set_tuned.xml. By inspecting this file with a text 
editor you can determine which alternate behaviors have been enabled.


TIPS
====

As this font is distributed at no cost, we are unable to provide a 
commercial level of personal technical support. The font has, however, 
been through some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most
situations. In particular, it has been tested and shown to work on 
Windows 10 and 11.

If you do find a problem, please do report it through the website: 
https://software.sil.org/annapurna/support/. 
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in 
future versions.

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding: 
This font does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. You may use the
built-in keyboards of the operating system. You may also need to install an
appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the language you
wish to use. If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any
system keyboard, the Keyman program (https://keyman.com) can be helpful
on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any system keyboard, 
and to access the full Unicode range, we suggest you use gucharmap, kcharselect 
on Ubuntu or similar software. Another method of entering some symbols is 
provided by a few applications such as Adobe InDesign. They can display a glyph 
palette that shows all the glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter 
them by clicking on the glyph you want.

Rendering:
This font is designed to work with two advanced font technologies, 
Graphite and OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType.


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
==============================

Install the fonts by decompressing the .zip archive and installing the fonts 
using the standard font installation process for .ttf (TrueType/OpenType) fonts 
for your platform. For additional tips on font installation, see the help page 
at https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation.
