Description
-----------
The Anglicized Wakhi script is based on the English alphabet or in other words could be termed as Latinate script. It was in 2011 that Dr. Boghsho Lashkarbekov envisioned, developed and incredibly simplified it with an addition of just a tilde sign (  ̃ ). He thus recommended and demonstrated this script along with some of his colleagues at different places for Wakhi language (as it had no popular written tradition at mass level) by then.  He envisioned that Anglicized script would unite all the Wakhi communities across the globe and they could benefit from the creativities and publications of each other. He was a native Tajik Wakhi linguist and Senior Scholar of Wakhi Pamiri language at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, as he dedicated more or less 40 years behind his linguistic work. His scholastic pursuits kept in mind the long term future prospects of English language on the one hand and the growing trend of the Wakhi youth, coming generations and the respective nation states towards teaching and learning English language on the other hand.
