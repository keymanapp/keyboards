  "description": "VNI is one of the most popular Vietnamese input method. Originally by VNI Software Company, it is often available on computer systems to type Vietnamese. Initually, VNI's input method utilized function keys (F1, F2...) to enter the tone marks, which later turned out to be problematic, as the operating system used those keys for other purposes. VNI then turned to the numerical keys for entering tone marks."
