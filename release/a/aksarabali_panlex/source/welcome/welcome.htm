<h1>Aksara Bali Unicode Keyboard</h1>

<p>Keyboard &#169; 2019 The PanLex Project of The Long Now Foundation</p>

<p>This keyboard lets you type Aksara Bali (Balinese script) in Unicode. It is a Unicode reimplementation of the Bali Simbar keyboard (the de-facto standard keyboard in Bali for typing in Balinese script).</p>

<p>The keyboard follows the Bali Simbar keyboard as closely as possible. Basic usage is as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Type according to Balinese Latin orthography. For example, [w] [a] [y] [a] [n] [space] types ⟨ᬯᬬᬦ᭄⟩.</li>
    <li>Right after you type a consonant, a question mark ⟨?⟩ appears after it. This indicates that the input is incomplete and you still need to type a vowel, consonant, or punctuation mark. The question mark automatically disappears after subsequent input.</li>
    <li>It is important to type [space] at the end of each word. This does not actually insert a space, but tells the keyboard not to apply certain automatic changes. For example, <em>bapan ceningé</em> typed without a space is incorrect: ⟨ᬩᬧᬜ᭄ᬘᭂᬦᬶᬗᬾ⟩. Using [space], the result is the correct ⟨ᬩᬧᬦ᭄ᬘᭂᬦᬶᬗᬾ⟩. In order to use explicit <em>adeg-adeg</em> between words, type [space] twice: ⟨ᬩᬧᬦ᭄‌ᬘᭂᬦᬶᬗᬾ⟩. To insert a space character, type [Shift-space].</li>
    <li>In order to override certain automatic changes after consonants, you may occasionally need to type [/]. This blocks various changes by inserting <em>adeg-adeg</em>. For example, typing [r] [/] ensures that [ᬭ] will not be converted to <em>surang</em>.
    <li>The most common modifiers are Shift and Ctrl-Shift. For example, [b] [e] types ⟨ᬩᭂ⟩ and [b] [Shift-e] types ⟨ᬩᬾ⟩; [s] types ⟨ᬲ⟩ and [s] [Ctrl-'] types ⟨ᬰ⟩.</li>
</ul>

<p>This keyboard contains several additions to the original Bali Simbar keyboard:</p>

<ul>
    <li>[/] types <em>adeg-adeg</em></li>
    <li>[Ctrl-Shift-/] types ⟨/⟩</li>
    <li>[Shift-number] types Arabic numerals, for example [Shift-1] types ⟨1⟩
    <li>[Ctrl-r] types <em>rerekan</em>, for example [p] [Ctrl-r] types ⟨ᬧ᬴⟩</li>
    <li>[Ctrl-Alt-o] types <em>windu</em> ⟨᭜⟩</li>
    <li>[Ctrl-Shift-,] types ⟨᭚᭜᭚⟩, repeat for ⟨᭟᭜᭟⟩</li>
    <li>[Ctrl-Shift-.] types ⟨᭛᭜᭛⟩, repeat for ⟨᭟᭜᭟⟩</li>
</ul>
