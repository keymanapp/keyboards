Lavanya keyboard
==============

Description
-----------
**Lavanya** is a custom transliteration keyboard that converts English input into Telugu text *dynamically* and *phonetically*. Inspired by [Lekhini](https://lekhini.org/), this keyboard retains the intuitive, vowel-explicit input style that made Lekhini accessible to new users. The core implementation builds upon the logic from the [NLCI Telugu Winscript Keyboard](https://keyman.com/keyboards/nlci_telugu_winscript), adapted for local system-wide use via Keyman. The layout was designed by Prashanth in 2025 to help his mother, who is already familiar with Lekhini. Refer to the documentation file for detailed keyboard usage. While Lavanya offers touch screen support, its not matured yet. Google's Gboard is an excellent keyboard for typing in Telugu on touchscreen devices.
