      <H1>Rachitrali-Kashmir-Shina Keyman Keyboard </H1>
<A name=intro></A>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>This keyboard was developed by Rehmat Aziz Chitrali for keyboarding the Kashmir-Shina language in the Arabic Script. The
      Rachitrali-Kashmir-Shina keyboard is designed to work with the  <A href="http://software.sil.org/Scheherazade" target=_blank>Scheherazade New</A>
      font. However, you can use this keyboard with any extended Arabic script Unicode font.  </P><A name=kmn></A>
<p><b>Caveat:</b> This keyboard is designed for an orthography that is not well supported by operating systems and applications. 
	It uses "vowel-marks" (combining marks) above "vowel-marks". In some instances some systems will display dotted circles 
	instead of positioning the second vowel above the first vowel. In other applications the ordering of the combining marks 
	may change. Some of these vowel marks are being used to form new characters with a base character. The ideal solution would 
	be to get the characters encoded in Unicode. </p>
