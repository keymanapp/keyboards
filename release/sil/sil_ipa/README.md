SIL IPA Keyboard Keyboard
=====================

Version 1.6

__DESCRIPTION__

The keyboard layout is described in terms of an IPA chart rather than a keyboard. This is because many base characters are typed as a sequence of a letter followed by one of <, > or = which are characters used to change a base character to another base character. Diacritics are typed as sequences of an appropriate key.
