IPA (SIL) Keyboard Keyboard
=====================

Copyright (C) SIL Global

__DESCRIPTION__

The keyboard layout is described in terms of an IPA chart 
rather than a keyboard. This is because many base 
characters are typed as a sequence of a letter followed 
by one of <, > or = which are characters used to change 
a base character to another base character. Diacritics are 
typed as sequences of an appropriate key.
