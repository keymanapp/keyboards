	<h1>SIL IPA keyboard for Keyman Desktop</h1>
<p><i>Martin Hosken and Lorna Evans,<br>
SIL Non-Roman Script Initiative (NRSI)</i></p>


<p>The SIL IPA Keyman keyboard is a mnemonic keyboard definition which 
enters Unicode values for IPA. This version 
of the keyboard supports a mnemonic layout. This 
allows a user to type with any kind of keyboard, 
rather than just a US keyboard. </p>

<h2>Keyboard Layout</h2>

<p>The keyboard layout is described in terms of an IPA chart rather than a keyboard. This is because many base characters are typed as a sequence of a letter followed by one of <, > or = which are characters used to change a base character to another base character. Diacritics are typed as sequences of an appropriate key.  Details of the 
keyboard layout may be found in the <span><a href='SILIPAKeyboardLayout.pdf'>"SILIPAKeyboardLayout.pdf</a></span>" document in the section on 
Keyboard Layout.</p>

<h2>Fonts</h2>

<p>SIL International has produced several Unicode font sets that allow for the transcription of linguistic data using the International Phonetic Alphabet and this keyboard. These fonts are:</p>
