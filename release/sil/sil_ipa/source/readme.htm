	<h1>IPA (SIL) keyboard for Keyman Desktop</h1>
<p><i>Martin Hosken and Lorna Evans</i></p>


<p>The IPA (SIL) Keyman keyboard is a mnemonic keyboard definition which 
enters Unicode values for IPA. This version 
of the keyboard supports a mnemonic layout. This 
allows a user to type with any kind of keyboard, 
rather than just a US keyboard. </p>

<h2>Keyboard Layout</h2>

<p>The keyboard layout is described in terms of an IPA chart rather than a keyboard. This is because many base characters are typed as a sequence of a letter followed by one of <, > or = which are characters used to change a base character to another base character. Diacritics are typed as sequences of an appropriate key.  Details of the 
keyboard layout may be found in the <span>"<a href='welcome/welcome.htm'>welcome.htm</a></span>" document in the section on 
Keyboard Layout.</p>

<p>The default for this keyboard is to type a letter followed by a "modifier". 
	For example, this sequence "b>" would produce "É“". If you wish to use the opposite sequence (>b) that is 
	possible. Use one or the other of these options. <b>Do not turn <i>Before</i> on with Keyman configuration 
  and off with the RALT hotkeys.</b> </p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Using Keyman Configuration</b>: On Windows, go to <b>Keyman Configuration</b>, 
	select the keyboard, click on <b>Keyboard options</b> and choose <b>Before</b>. 
	You may need to exit Keyman configuration before the default behavior changes. This method will change your default to <i>Before</i> and 
	everytime you switch to this keyboard it will remain using the <i>Before</i> style until you change it back to <i>After</i> style using <b>Keyman configuration</b>.</li>
<li><b>Using RALT hotkeys</b>: It is also possible to switch from <i>After</i> to <i>Before</i> using the RALT HYPHEN sequence (RALT+-). 
	Switch back to <i>After</i> using the RALT EQUAL sequence (RALT+=). This method will change to <i>Before</i> during just this session of 
	using the keyboard. After you stop using the keyboard it will return to <i>After</i>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Fonts</h2>

<p>SIL International has produced several Unicode font sets that allow for the transcription of linguistic data using the International Phonetic Alphabet and this keyboard. These fonts are:</p>
