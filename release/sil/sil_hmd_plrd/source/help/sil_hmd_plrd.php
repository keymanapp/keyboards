<p>This keyboard was designed for the Ahmao [hmd] language using the Miao script. The keyboard supports both the Augmented Traditional character set as well as the Normalised character set. A font must be installed to support this keyboard. A Miao font specifically designed for use with the hmd language is available here: <a href="http://software.sil.org/shimenkan/">http://software.sil.org/shimenkan/</a>. The Sapushan font is also packaged with this keyboard.</p>
