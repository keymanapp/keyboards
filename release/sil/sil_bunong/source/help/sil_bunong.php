<p>
    This keyboard is designed for typing Bunong language using Khmer characters.
</p>

<p>
	Khmer Mondulkiri font is embedded and included in the keyboard package. It will be installed and uninstalled along with the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
	All vowels on the phone layout are highlighted to help you locate where the Bunong vowels are on both the Default and Shift layers.
</p>

<p>
	Rota rules help you to flick through the similar characters. These work on both the desktop and touch layotus.
