  "description": "This keyboard is for typing Cipher music notation (where numbers represent notes). The Cipher music notation is used throughout Indonesia and China for all kinds of music. The keyboard is not intended for general orthographic use, although it is usable for song lyrics in simple Roman writing systems. This solution is primarily intended for fairly straightforward songbooks for singers, not for complex instrumental music. It can handle harmony lines fine, but not a lot of intricacies or subtleties (e.g. no staccato). The default for this keyboard is Indonesian kepatihan. The keyboard has an option key to change to Chinese jianpu. Please read the documentation for how to switch to Chinese jianpu."
