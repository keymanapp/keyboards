Cipher Music (SIL) keyboard
===========================

Â© 2009-2019 SIL International

Version 1.0

Description
-----------

This keyboard is for typing Cipher music notation (where numbers 
represent notes).

The Cipher music notation is used throughout Indonesia and China 
for all kinds of music. The keyboard is not intended for general 
orthographic use, although it is usable for song lyrics in simple 
Roman writing systems. This solution is primarily intended for 
fairly straightforward songbooks for singers, not for complex 
instrumental music. It can handle harmony lines fine, but not a 
lot of intricacies or subtleties (e.g. no staccato).

This keyboard and the Doulos SIL Cipher font (which will be installed
with this keyboard) work best with applications using the Graphite 
rendering technology, such as LibreOffice.

Please note: The English and Indonesian documentation has been changed slightly
to reflect differences in how Keyman works from the original InKey keyboard.
The Indonesian translation has not been checked with an Indonesian speaker.
