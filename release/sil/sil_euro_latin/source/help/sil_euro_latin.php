<p>The EuroLatin keyboard enables you to type in <b>all</b> European languages which use Latin-script and many Latin-script languages from the rest of the world. However, the keyboard should not be expected to be enhanced for languages outside of Europe. The keyboard is designed to be used with any Latin hardware keyboard. It uses simple sequences of <code>symbol + character</code> to type letters and other characters not available on a standard keyboard.</p>

<h1>Fonts</h1>

<p>Most of the characters in this keyboard are included in the fonts Calibri, Cambria, Arial, and Times New Roman, as well as many other fonts. Some of the characters in this keyboard are only supported by specialty fonts, like Code2000.</p>

    <h2>Mobile Keyboard Layout</h2>
    <p>
    Variants of each letter may be found via longpress, while the letter in the top-right may be
    typed by touching the key and then dragging down.
    <br />
    On the numeric layer, each key matches its position on the default layer. 
    The second and third row's keys each offer a different key that may be typed using the same
    touch-and-drag technique as described for the default layer. Curly brackets are available via longpress on the <kbd>(</kbd> and <kbd>)</kbd> keys.
    <br />
    Note that the keys have changed position compared to 2.x versions of the keyboard.
