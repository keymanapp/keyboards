  <h1>Tai Dam Latin (SIL) keyboard</h1>

<p>
    SIL's Tai Dam Typewriter keyboard is intended for typing the Tai Dam language with the Tai Viet script. The layout is based on that a manual typewriter which was custom built for the Tai Dam community in the U.S. in the late 1970s, with two minor alterations: First, some of the punctuation has been rearranged to include punctuation characters that were not on the maual typewriters, but are often needed in an electronic environment. (E.g. the @ sign which is needed for email addresses.) Second, the vowel Mai Kang was added, even though it was not on the original typewriter layout, since some Tai Dam dialects use it.

<p>
    Note that this layout lacks the six aspirated consonants that are unique to Tai DoÃÅn, so it cannot be used for typing that language. It also lacks the consonants Low Go, High Go, Low Ro, and High Ro. These four characters were added to Unicode for spelling loan words, especially Vietnamese names that contain the letters 'g' and 'r'. However, none of them occur in native Tai Dam words.
