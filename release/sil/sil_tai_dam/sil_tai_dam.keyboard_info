    "description": "The Tai Dam (SIL) keyboard is designed for typing Tai Dam text using the Tai Viet script. It uses a mnemonic layout based on the US English keyboard. That is, each Tai Viet character is assigned to the key with the nearest equivalent US English letter. It is also possible to key the Tai Don aspirated consonants using two-key sequences, but the keyboard is not optimized for these characters.",
