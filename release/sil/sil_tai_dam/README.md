__DESCRIPTION__
The SIL Tai Dam keyboard is designed for typing Tai Dam text using the Tai Viet script. The layout is based on the US English keyboard, with each Tai Viet character assigned to the key with the nearest equivalent US English letter.

It is also possible to key the Tai Don aspirated consonants using two-key sequences, but the keyboard is not optimized for these characters.
