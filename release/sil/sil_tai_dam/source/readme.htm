<h1>Tai Dam (SIL) keyboard</h1>

<p>The Tai Dam (SIL) keyboard has been optimized for typing the Tai Viet script as it is used for writing the Tai Dam language. It can also be used for typing the Tai Dón language, but the six aspirated consonants that are unique to Tai Dón require two keystrokes (as do four other consonants that are only used in loan words).</p>

<p>The keyboard layout assigns each Tai Viet character to the key with the nearest equivalent letter on a US English keyboard. Low series consonants are assigned to unshifted keys, and high series consonants are assigned to the equivalent shifted key.</p>
