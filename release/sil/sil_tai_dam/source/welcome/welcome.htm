<h1>SIL Tai Dam keyboard</h1>

<p>The SIL Tai Dam keyboard has been optimized for typing the Tai Viet script as it is used for writing the Tai Dam language. It can also be used for typing the Tai Dón language, but the six aspirated consonants that are unique to Tai Dón require two keystrokes (as do four other consonants that are only used in loan words).</p>

<p>The keyboard is a mnemonic layout based in the US English keyboard. That is, each Tai Viet character is assigned to the key that has the nearest equivalent English letter. Low series consonants are assigned to unshifted keys, and high series consonants are assigned to the equivalent shifted key.</p>

<p>See <a href="file:sil_tai_dam_layout.pdf">the accompaning PDF file</a> for charts of the keyboard layout.</p>
