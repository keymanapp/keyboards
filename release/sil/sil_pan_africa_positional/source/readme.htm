  <h1>Pan Africa Positional (SIL) Keyboard</h1>
  <p>This is the positional version of the Pan Africa (SIL) keyboard. 
  	The keyboard layout was designed to work with a QWERTY US English keyboard. For a keyboard that is not 
  	dependent on a particular hardware keyboard, use "Pan Africa Mnemonic (SIL)."</p>

<p>This keyboard was developed to type the Latin-script languages of Africa.  An attempt was made to 
cover the orthographic needs for SIL in many of the countries of Africa, but this cannot be 
considered a complete list, nor should it be considered an endorsement for this particular layout.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>If you need to use the ALT combinations, you'll need to use Keyman Configuration to change the Keyman hotkeys.</p>
