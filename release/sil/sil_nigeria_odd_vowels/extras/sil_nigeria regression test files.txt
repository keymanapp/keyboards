In Debug pane, select Regression testing tab
Options menu button, Open regression test... menu item, navigate to desired .xml file
Once the file is loaded, click on Start Test button to run.
If test is successful, a message "Regression test was successful." is displayed.
If not, the point at which there is a disagreement between the regression test data
and the actual data produced by the keyboard is displayed.

There are three related keyboards:
* sil_nigeria_odd_vowels
* sil_nigeria_dot
* sil_nigeria_underline

There are four regression test files:
* sil_nigeria_common.xml -- common to all three keyboards
* sil_nigeria_odd for sil_nigeria_odd_vowels
* sil_nigeria_dot for sil_nigeria_dot
* sil_nigeria_underline for sil_nigeria_underline

Information for the apostrophe rota is not included in any of these files
and must be tested manually.
