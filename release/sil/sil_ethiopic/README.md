SIL Ethiopic Keyboard
=====================

Copyright (C) 2010-2019 SIL Ethiopia

Version 2.0.2

The “SIL Ethiopic” keyboard was developed to input Ethiopic Fidel scripts. You can use this keyboard with any Ethiopic Unicode font unless you need to use the newer Unicode 6.0+ Ethiopic codepoints (for Basketo, Gumuz and Gamo-Gofa-Dawro) or the two Private Use Area (PUA) characters of this keyboard. The Abyssinica SIL font (version 1.5+) is recommended if you need to use these newer Unicode 6.0+ or PUA characters.
