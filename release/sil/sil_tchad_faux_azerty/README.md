__DESCRIPTION__
This keyboard enables the typing of all Chadian languages using the Chadian National Alphabet. It gives the ability to type all the special characters and diacritics in this standard alphabet, as well as many additional useful characters such as phonetic symbols and French characters. It helps to avoid changes to the keyboard layout, such as changing QWERTY to AZERTY, hence its name, “faux AZERTY”.
