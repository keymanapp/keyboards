Version 1.4

__DESCRIPTION__
Burmese Keyboard for Unicode Encoding. This Layout has been designed to resemble that used by WinMyanmar Systems, however, it is much simplified because of the advantages of Unicode technology. Some keys have changed as a result.

## Supported Platforms
 * Windows
 * macOS
 * Web

## TO DO
 * The line "store(sil_myanmar_mywinext.ico)" in the sil_myanmar_mywinext.kmn file serves no purpose and may be a source of confusion. It should be removed the next time this keyboard is updated (or if this keyboard is used as a basis for another keyboard).
