<h1>Yorùbá 8</h1>
  <section id='overview'>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Yorùbá 8 is a simple Unicode keyboard for the Yorùbá language, with the option to use either the modern dot or the traditional bar under the letters <samp>ẹ</samp>|<samp>e̩</samp>, <samp>ọ</samp>|<samp>o̩</samp>, and <samp>ṣ</samp>|<samp>s̩</samp>.</p> 
	<h4>Basic Function</h4>
	<p>The Yorùbá 8 keyboard adapts to your default Windows layout. You can type all of the special Yorùbá letters and accents with Yorùbá 8. For example, type <kbd>q</kbd> for <samp>gb</samp> or <kbd>[</kbd> for <samp>`</samp> (grave accent). Accents are typed after the base letter and can be added to vowels as well as <samp>m</samp> and <samp>n</samp>. When the keyboard is on, type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> to switch between the dot form and the bar form of the letters <samp>ẹ</samp>|<samp>e̩</samp>, <samp>ọ</samp>|<samp>o̩</samp>, and <samp>ṣ</samp>|<samp>s̩</samp>. Keyman Desktop remembers your choice whenever you return to use the keyboard.</p>
	<aside><b>Note:</b> For best practice, we do not recommend using both the dot and the bar forms of the Yorùbá letters in the same document.</aside>	
	<h4>Fonts</h4>
	<p>This is a Unicode keyboard and works with any Unicode font which has support for Yorùbá. </p>
	<h4>On Screen Keyboard</h4>
	<p>This keyboard includes an On Screen Keyboard view for easy reference. The On Screen Keyboard displays best on a QWERTY US layout.</p>
