<p>This keyboard is designed for use with the ɁAreɂare language of Solomon Islands. It includes an
on screen keyboard which can be viewed by clicking on the Keyman icon and 
selecting the On Screen Keyboard menu item. </p>

<p>Special key combinations are as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>g = </td>
<td>&#x0242;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>G = </td>
<td>&#x0241;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CTRL + ALT + g = </td>
<td>g</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SHIFT+ CTRL + ALT + G = </td>
<td>G</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The keyboard layout of this language is very similar to that of the English keyboard, except the two special keys.</p>
