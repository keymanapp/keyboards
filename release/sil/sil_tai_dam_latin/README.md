Description
-----------
SIL's Tai Dam Latin keyboard has been designed for typing the Tai Dam and Tai Dón languages in the Latin script. It has been optimized for the Tai Dam language by moving three of the more frequently used tone marks to the center of the keyboard, in order to reduce hand strain.
