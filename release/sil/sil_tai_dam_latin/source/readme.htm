<h1>Tai Dam Latin (SIL) keyboard</h1>

<p>SIL's Tai Dam Latin keyboard has been designed for typing the Tai Dam language in the Latin script. It can also be used for typing the Tai Dón language in the Latin scrit.</p>

<p>Two strategies have been employed to optimize the keyboard for the Tai Dam language and reduce hand strain:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Three of the more frequently used tone marks are placed in the center of the keyboard, on the <b>R</b>, <b>F</b>, and <b>D</b> keys.</li>
    <li>To make it easy to also type R, F, and D, output of the tone marks is controlled by context sensitivity. The <b>R</b>, <b>F</b>, and <b>D</b> keys will output a tone mark only after a vowel. In other contexts, they will produce the letters R, F, and D. </li>
</ul>

<p>This is a practical solution because the letter D never occurs in Tai Dam after a vowel, and the letters R and F only occur in loan words. The alternative approach of placing the tone marks in the corners of the keyboard results in a very heavy load for the little fingers to carry when typing, resulting in severe hand strain.</p>
