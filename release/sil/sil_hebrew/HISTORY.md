*  All PUA characters above have been replaced by the following, according to an agreement with other font designers and because PUA characters are not really usable in commercial software at this time.
    * d78 Hebrew reversed nun with dot - use Nun Hafukha(05C6)CGJ 0307
    * d170 Hebrew Mark Lower Dot - now defined as 05C5
    * Right Meteg - use 05BD CGJ before the low vowel or other low marks
    * Left Meteg with Hataf - use Hataf ZWNJ 05BD
* Note that U+05BD Hebrew Point Meteg is coded in the Ezra SIL fonts to always fall to the left of the vowel, except for with hatafs, it falls medially. These are the most common positions of meteg in BHS.
