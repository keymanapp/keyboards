Ezra SIL font family
========================


This file provides detailed information on the Ezra SIL fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Ezra SIL font and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Ezra SIL is the same typeface as SIL Ezra and is fashioned after the 
square letter forms of the typography of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia 
(BHS), a beautiful Old Testament volume familiar to biblical Hebrew scholars. 
The Ezra SIL font is an OpenType 'smart' font.  

Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:

     * Ezra SIL version 2.5 (Containing the basic set of Unicode 
        characters needed for Biblical Hebrew texts following the 
        typeface and traditions of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia.)
     * Ezra SIL SR version 2.5 (Containing the same set of Unicode 
        characters as above but with a different style of cantillation.) 

SIL International is the creator of the Ezra SIL fonts, and is the owner
of all proprietary rights therein.

Information for Contributors
----------------------------

The release of Ezra SIL version 2.5 (and any subsequent versions) under the 
OFL license provides a means for people to improve the fonts as needed.  
Anyone can make their own modified version of Ezra SIL (using a different name), 
but SIL International will continue to maintain and develop the
canonical version of the Ezra SIL fonts. For information on what you're 
allowed to change or modify, consult the OFL and OFL-FAQ.

At this point we are not actively soliciting contributions to the project.
Although we will remain the package maintainer, we do not currently
plan major upgrades, but will gratefully accept bug reports.

The sources files FontLab and VOLT are available in the separate 
developers download.

Linux packages: Please contact the upstream maintainer of the various 
packages - nicolas.spalinger@sil.org - if you want to help package or 
maintain a package.
