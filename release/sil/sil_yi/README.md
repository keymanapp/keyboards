SIL Yi Keyboard
=====================

Copyright (C) SIL International


DESCRIPTION
-------------------
Yi keyboard layout using pinyin input for typing standard Nuosu Yi characters and basic full-width punctuation. 
Text generated will be in utf-8 encoding, and can be viewed with a font such as Nuosu SIL. Type a Nuosu Yi syllable 
in roman letters, then SPACE to convert to the syllabary character. Punctuation is full-width - note 
the keystrokes at the bottom of the list for typing things like book title brackets and left and right Chinese 
quotation marks. For instance, typing two left angle brackets in a row will produce a Chinese left double book title 
bracket. Typing a backslash produces a Chinese dunhao. Typing two left single quotes in a row produces a full-width 
left double quotation mark.
