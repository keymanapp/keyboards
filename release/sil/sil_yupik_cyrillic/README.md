=====================

Copyright (C) 2006-2020 SIL International

Version 2.0.2


__DESCRIPTION__
This keyboard implements the Cyrillic script for the Central Siberian Yupik language (ess-Cyrl). It is based on the layout of an earlier keyboard which had been implemented in the legacy encoding introduced into the SIL language project around 1990, but now implements that layout in Unicode.
