Pan Africa Mnemonic (SIL) Keyboard
=====================

Copyright (C) SIL International

__DESCRIPTION__
This is the mnemonic version of the Pan Africa (SIL) keyboard. It features a layout that adjusts 
to the arrangement of keys on your hardware keyboard. For a keyboard tailored to the US hardware 
keyboard, use "Pan Africa Positional (SIL)". 

This keyboard was developed to type the Latin-script languages of Africa.  An attempt was made to 
cover the orthographic needs for SIL in many of the countries of Africa, but this cannot be 
considered a complete list, nor should it be considered an endorsement for this particular layout.
