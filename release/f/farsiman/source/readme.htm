<p>Farsiman is a farsi phonetic keyboard that enables anyone who uses a regular
English keyboard write in Farsi. Look at the three screenshots in the
welcome.htm and you are immediately ready to write away in Farsi.</p>
<p>SIL Global helped whenever I raised a hand. This keyboard is the
result of, and gratitude to their generosity and competence.</p>
