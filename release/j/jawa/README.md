__DESCRIPTION__
This keyboard is designed to type all Javanese characters and stacks directly. You get a Javanese character every time you press a key, without having to use the Alt key or memorizing arbitrary key locations in QWERTY keyboard. This keyboard is based on Benny Lin's Nulisa Aksara Jawa web transliterator program - http://is.gd/nulisa.
