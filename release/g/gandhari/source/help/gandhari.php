<p>
    Gandhari Sanskrit keyboard developed for Latin transliteration of Gāndhārī language written in the Kharoṣṭhī script.
</p>
<p>This keyboard makes heavy use of "deadkeys". These keys are described in the downloadable documentation below. Where the keyboard mentions the CTRL key, the LEFT CTRL key should be used. Where the keyboard mentions the ALT key, the RIGHT ALT key should be used.</p>

    Documentation for this keyboard is available here: <a href="gandhari-keyboard_keyman.pdf">gandhari-keyboard_keyman.pdf</a>
