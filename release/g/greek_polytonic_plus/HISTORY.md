# greek\_polytonic\_plus Change History
## 2.0 (2024-10-26)
* Created by David J. Perry
* Renamed Greek Polytonic Plus (version 1 was called Greek Polytonic Unicode).
* Changed source file from ANSI to UTF-8 encoding.
* Removed code that allowed AltGr characters to be entered with Ctrl+Alt, which enables the Option key to work properly on Mac (use Keyman Configuration option to get this behavior on Windows).
* Incorporated many archaic letters and symbols added to Unicode since the release of the original keyboard, all 
entered with the new deadkey \.  
* Added the combining coronis, U+0343, using Shift-AltGr-_ 
(underscore).
* Combinations of breathing, accent and iota subscript can 
now be entered in any order.
* For ano teleia (Greek colon), replaced U+0387 with U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT, which the Unicode chart says is preferred.
* Replaced East Asian brackets (double-width) with non-East Asian equivalents.
* Corrected Upsilon-breve (previous version produced Ῡ not Ῠ when ?-Y was typed).
* Added on-screen keyboard.  
* Created Mac OS, Linux and web versions.
* Expanded and improved the documentation.
