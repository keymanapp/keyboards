<h1>Greek Polytonic Plus</h1>

<p>
This keyboard provides access to all characters needed for monotonic and polytonic Greek. It was designed with the needs of scholars in mind but can be easily used for any Greek text. It covers all the characters in the Greek and Coptic and Greek Extended blocks of Unicode (including archaic letters and symbols) as well as some additional characters needed by scholars and publishers. An on-screen keyboard is included.
