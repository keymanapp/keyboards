  <p>This keyboard is designed for the Innu language of Canada. 
  	The keyboard follows a standard US QWERTY keyboard layout. 
</p>
  	

<h1>Keyboard Layout</h1>
<p>To access the superscript u and U, type the consonant followed by a "w". 
  	For example "kw" becomes "kᵘ, "mw" becomes "mᵘ" "shw" becomes "shᵘ" and "tw" becomes "tᵘ". 
  	These are also available for uppercase. If "kᵘ" is subsequently followed by "a", "e", "i", or "u", 
  	then the raised "u" becomes a "w" again ("kwa" remains "kwa").</p>
<p>Circumflex vowels are available by doubling the vowel. For example, typing "aa" becomes "â" (this is available
	for "a", "e", "i", and "u" as well as for uppercase. </p>
