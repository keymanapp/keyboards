<p>Roman keyboard for typing vowel length (circumflex "hats" over vowels) in roman orthography (East Cree).</p>

<p>Hats over long vowels (and tilde over "n") are available by typing two letters in a row. Thus, typing "aa" would become "칙", and typing "nn" would become "침". These are available for aiun and AIUN.</p>
