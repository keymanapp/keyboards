<h1>Start Using Naskapi (Common)</h1>

<p>
    The Naskapi (Common) keyboard is a phonetic-style (type the word the way it sounds) layout. It uses Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics.
</p>

<h1>Keyboard Layout</h1>

<p>
The keyboard layout of this keyboard is like that of the QWERTY keyboard which most are already familair with. The system is essentially this: the user types in roman letters on a standard keyboard the way the word “sounds” in Naskapi. What he sees on the screen as he types is the word written in syllabics. 
</p>

<p>
A benefit inherent in this system is that the hardware (the keyboard) does not need to be modified in any way with special key-caps or stickers, a new keyboard does not have to be learned and memorized, and that syllabics and non-syllabics (roman) words can be mixed in at any time in any place in the document.
</p>

The BJCree Uni font is included in the package.
