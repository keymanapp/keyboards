<div class="msg-important">
  <p><b>Important Notice:</b> The default for this keyboard is for characters to be composed. For example, this sequence "wa" would produce ᐘ (U+1418).</p>
  <p>You can change the keyboard to produce decomposed characters in two ways. The preferred method is to use <b>Keyman → Configuration</b>.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Using Keyman Configuration</b>: On Windows or Linux, go to <b>Keyman → Configuration → Keyboard Layouts → BJ-OjiCree (Kingfisher) → Keyboard Options</b> and choose <b>Decomposed</b>. 
	You may need to close and reopen your input application and keyboard, before the default behavior changes. This method will change your default to <i>Decomposed</i> and 
	everytime you switch to this keyboard it will remain using the <i>Decomposed</i> style until you change it back to <i>Composed</i> style using <b>Keyman configuration</b>.</li>
<li><b>Using RALT hotkeys</b> (primarily needed for macOS): It is also possible to switch from <i>Composed</i> to <i>Decomposed</i> using the RALT EQUAL sequence (RALT+=). 
	Switch back to <i>Composed</i> using the SHIFT RALT EQUAL sequence (SHIFT+RALT+=). This method will change to <i>Decomposed</i> during just this session of 
	using the keyboard. After you stop using the keyboard it will return to <i>Composed</i>.</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
    This keyboard is distinguished by: western finals, w-dot follows the character (Western Cree style), zig-zag R's and L's. It uses Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics.
