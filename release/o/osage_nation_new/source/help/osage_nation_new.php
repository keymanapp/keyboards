<p>This keyboard layout was developed on behalf of the Osage Nation Language Department 
with the intention of replacing previous layouts (partially for reasons pertaining 
to orthography reforms that have been carried since the last Osage keyboard was developed)
</p>
<h2>Font</h2>
<p>
The keyboard is designed to work any Osage script font. It comes with the Noto Sans Osage font. Other Osage fonts, such as Pawhuska, are available from <a href="http://osagelanguagetools.appspot.com/downloads/" target=_blank>Osage Nation</a>.
