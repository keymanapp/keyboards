# Pre-Vedic Sanskrit Devanagari Phonetic (OPTITRANS) 
## Description

Pre-Vedic Sanskrit Devanagari Phonetic (OPTITRANS) keyboard is Sanskrit devanAgarI input method by a modified version of OPTITRANS and Harvard-Kyoto transliteration systems with the following special features:

- greater reliance on reconstructed early vedic pronunciation (details and demo [here](https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/registers/early-vedic)) 
  - ai=ए, Ai=ऐ, au=ओ, Au=औ.
  - emphasis on the udAtta accent instead of svarita.
- allow input of hrasva ऎ and ऒ.
- support for common dravidian sounds (useful for maNipravALa).

You can use all the standard ITRANS key sequences plus key
sequences such as the below.

nk->ङ्क्, nkh->ङ्ख्, ng->ङ्ग्, ngh->ङ्घ्
nch->ञ्च्, nCh->ञ्छ्, nc->ञ्च्, nC->ञ्छ्, nchh->ञ्छ्,
nj->ञ्ज्, njh->ञ्झ्, nT->ण्ट्, nTh->ण्ठ्, nD->ण्ड्, nDh->ण्ढ्
c->च्, C->छ्, z->श्, S->ष्, jn->ज्ञ्, R->ऋ

Examples: Type `saMskRta` for संस्कृत.
