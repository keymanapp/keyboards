Mro Phonetic keyboard
==============

© 2020 SIL International

Version 1.0

Description
-----------

The Mro script is used by the Mro (sometimes “Mru”) people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in 
southeastern Bangladesh. It was invented by a member of the community in the 1980s, and 
apparently the majority of the community are now literate in it.

This keyboard uses a phonetic layout for the Mro/Mru language using the Mro script. It is based on 
the Linux keyboard which is available here: http://phjamr.github.io/mro.html
The author encourages others to build on his work. This keyboard does not support the ALT keys for Latin 
or Bengali. It solely supports the Mro script.
