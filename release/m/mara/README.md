# Mara Keyboard

This keyboard is for the Mara language.

## Description

The Mara Keyboard is designed for the Mara people to type easily in their language.

The Mara Keyboard is based on the standard English (QWERTY) layout, but includes special characters for the Mara language.

*   The **Q** key has been replaced with **Â** (unshifted **â**).
*   The **X** key has been replaced with **Ô** (unshifted **ô**).
*   The **J** key produces the digraph **CH** (unshifted **ch**).

This allows for easy typing of the Mara alphabet. The rest of the keys follow the standard QWERTY layout.

The touch layout for phones follows a similar pattern, with the special characters readily available on the main keyboard layer.
