# History of Mozhi Layout
Initially there was 'Kerala.com' guestbook, for Malayalees world over to come together and discuss. Tony Thomas, who pioneered writing in Malayalam characters, used 'Kerala' font by clicking on Malayalam letters in ‘Charmap’ application. The year was 1996.

## Lathi
In the meantime, Binu Thomas Meledom, Binu Anand P.S, Konda Reddy, and Soji Joseph coded an application called 'Lathi', which used Achayan transliteration scheme. The transliteration engine was written by Sreedhar Shenoy.

## Varamozhi
Parallelly, Cibu C.J developed a Unix command line application called ‘Varamozhi’, which transliterated from any transliteration scheme to any given Malayalam font. The name of the package, ‘Varamozhi’ was suggested by [Vinod](http://www.nitc.ac.in/nitc/user_profile/index.jsp?__tg_login=pathari) and the Logo was designed by [Rajesh](http://rajsid.tripod.com/personal.htm).

## Madhuri
Soon, Binu Thomas Meledom, Binu Anand P.S. and Konda Reddy created another application, 'Madhuri' using Cibu's Varamozhi transliteration engine. 'Madhuri' became very popular among the Kerala diaspora.

Cibu C.J created Varamozhi Editor application in June 2002, with Unicode and multi-font capabilities. Most of the 'Madhuri' users who also happened to be members of Varamozhi yahoogroup slowly changed over to the new Varamozhi Editor.

Varamozhi gradually made inroads into Malayalam Internet communities. In 2004 November, it achieved a greater pace when a fellow active participant 'Viswam' suggested using Mozhi, Varamozhi combination as the base of communication in Aksharaslokam group, a yahoo group led by [Umesh Nair](http://malayalam.usvishakh.net/blog/). The extreme requirement of accurate spellings in the group also turned out to be a critical test-bedfor the fault-tolerance and accuracy of varamozhi editor and the built-in dictionary.

Later, ['Malayalam Wikipedia'](http://ml.wikipedia.org/) and the blogger community followed the same path in their inspired movement of adapting to UNICODE Malayalam text. Most of the members and participants in the [forums of chinta](http://chintha.com/), the first independednt Unicode malayalam site, were also participated in this silent revolution. [Malayalavedhi.com](http://www.malayalavedhi.com/) was another forum where varamozhi was being introduced by and among it's members.

## Keyman
In June 2005, [Raj Nair](http://peringz.googlepages.com/) created 'Mozhi Keyman' using [Tavultesoft Keyman](http://www.tavultesoft.com/keyman/Tavultesoft) with inputs from Sunny Varghese who had earlier created a similar application, 'Vamozhi', with Tavultesoft Keyman. Mozhi Keyman became part of Varamozhi in July 2005. We would like to thank Raj for his dedication in developing a previous implementation of the Mozhi layout. This layout has been developed independently but we owe a debt of gratitude to Raj for the hard work he put into his Mozhi implementation.

Kevin who was a great admirer of ‘Rachana’application and its philosophy created ‘Anjali’, a Malayalam Unicode Font, out of 6 independent GPL’d font files from Rachana. Later, when the Rachana team decided to create their own Malayalam Unicode Font, they asked Kevin to discontinue creating Anjali using Rachana files. That prompted Kevin to create AnjaliOldLipi from scratch and it became part of the Varamozhi group in September of 2005.

In 2007, Cibu removed most stacking, U-sign and UU-sign, RA-sign conjuncts from AnjaliOldLipi and created [AnjaliNewLipi](https://sites.google.com/site/cibu/anjalioldlipi-font) to aid easier reading in small font sizes. Released under SIL OFL 1.1.

Since then, many Malayalam domains have provided interfaces for mozhi compatible user input on their sites like in Malayalam Wikipedia.

## Ilamozhi
In 2006, [Antony Deign](http://adeign.googlepages.com/ilamozhi.html), another malayalam blogger, created an online interactive lite version of the program. This was primarily aimed at those who can not install the core programs locally on their systems.

## Mozhi Offline
Later in 2007 Aug-Sept, [Raj Nair (Peringodan)](http://peringz.googlepages.com) developed a more refined [javascript](http://peringz.googlepages.com/mozhi_offline.htm) version which could be used both on-line and off-line. Shortly, the same script was incorporated into Malayalam Wikipedia input pages. In 2011, Junaid P V transformed this tool as a pan-Indic transliteration tool named Naaraayam extension supporting Mozhi for Malayalam along with many other languages. Currently it is evolved as ULS in Wikipedia.

As of late 2007, the major chunk of fresh Malayalam Unicode text on and off the net, (predominantly by the blogger and wikipedia community) is being produced using either Varamozhi Editor or Mozhi keyman or a combination of Varamozhi tools. It is also popularly used for applications such as electronic mailing and internet messaging. Those who are familiar with the scheme also makes use of the mangLIish input method - malayalam contend in English letters) for easy and unambigous text for mobile SMS and PDA-like non-malayalam environments.

## Keymagic
After some years, Mozhi Keyman became unmaintained. Then a [Keymagic](https://keymagic.net/downloads/) module for [Malayalam Mozhi](http://bloghelpline.cyberjalakam.com/2011/03/blog-post_20.html) following Mozhi scheme was written by Junaid P V in 2011 March. ([Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/keymagic), [Naaraayam exe](http://naaraayam.googlecode.com/files/KeyMagic-1.4-Malayalam-setup.exe)).

## Varamozhi Mobile
In 2012 Feb and Apr, [Jeesmon Jacob](https://github.com/jeesmon) compiled the Varamozhi source code for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jeesmon.apps.varamozhi) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/varamozhi/id514987251) to create Varamozhi apps in both the platforms.

## InKey
In 2015 Benjamin Varghese created a [Mozhi module for InKey](http://inkeysoftware.com/keyboard/mlym-Mozhi/index.html) application. 

## Keyman Mozhi 2 (Updated)
In early 2018, Junaid created [a new Keman Keyboard for Mozhi (Malayalam)](https://keyman.com/keyboards/mozhi_malayalam). Benjamin Varghese with the help of Binila Sanki maintained this keyboard.

## Keyman Mozhi 3 (Auto generated)
Cibu has written an engine that can auto generate the Keyman Rules directly from the spec. The 2022 release includes the rules generated using this tool. The underlying spec is still Mozhi Spec 2.0.
