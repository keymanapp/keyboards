Version 2.0.6

__DESCRIPTION__
This keyboard uses the Mozhi layout to let you type in Malayalam. It is a phonetic keyboard, based on the normal English (QWERTY) keyboard letters. This keyboard supports Unicode 11. Mozhi Malayalam was originally created by Raj Nair, but the source is lost. Junaid created a new source and this release is based on Junaid's code.

A word of gratitude and Appreciation
------------------------------------
We would like to thank Raj for his dedication in developing a previous implementation of the Mozhi layout. This layout has been developed independently but we owe a debt of gratitude to Raj for the hard work he put into his Mozhi implementation
