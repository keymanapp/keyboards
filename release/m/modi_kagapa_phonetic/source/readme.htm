<h1>Modi KaGaPa Phonetic</h1>

<p>
  This layout is the KaGaPa phonetic layout for a historically important script, called 'Modi'. It was prominently used to write Marathi, and in a few instances, for Hindi and Sanskrit. It is phonetically equivalent to Devanagari KaGaPa Phonetic, i.e., using similar character mapping, but for Modi letters.
