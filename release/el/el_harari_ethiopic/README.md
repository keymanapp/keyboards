Harari (Ethiopic) Keyboard
=====================

Copyright (C) 2006-2017 State Library of Victoria

Version 2.2

Harari Unicode keyboard layout. This keyboard layout was designed for use with the Harari Ethiopic (Geez) orthography. The input sequences are based on the Harari Latin orthography adopted by the Harari Community Language school in Melbourne, Australia. The Latin script is used to teach the younger Harari children their own language.

This keyboard layout has been designed to facilitate typing in the Ethiopic (Geez) script by young students who have studied the Harari language using the Latin script.

if you have not learnt Harari using the Latin orthography, please use one of the other Ethiopic keyboard layouts that are available.
