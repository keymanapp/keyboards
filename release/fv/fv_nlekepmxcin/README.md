<!-- TODO
-------------------
* New character codes are being released with Unicode 16.0, fall 2024:
* NEW: U+A7DC LATING CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA WITH STROKE
* This info should be relayed to speaker communities and decide if existing char should be updated
* Desktop was updated to include the new character since the old alternative used doesn't work, but mobile should be discussed
