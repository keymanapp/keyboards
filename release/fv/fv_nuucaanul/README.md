<!-- TODO
-------------------
* New character codes are being released with Unicode 16.0, fall 2024:
* NEW: U+A7DC LATIN CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA WITH STROKE
* U+A7DC was added to desktop keyboard as the current character used doesn't work, left lowercase option on Mobile Layout
* This info should be relayed to speaker communities and decide if existing char should be updated
