<h1>Keyboard Layout</h1>

<p>
The Haisla keyboard uses the English keyboard as a base, with added key combinations in order to create special characters. See <a href="fv_haisla_keycombos.pdf">this document</a> for all the special key combinations.</p>

<h2>Desktop Keyboard Layout</h2>
<div id='osk' data-states='default shift'>
</div>

<h2>Mobile/Tablet Keyboard Layout</h2>
<p>Due to the size and number of keys, some characters are hidden in the long press.
Press and hold on the key with a little dot on the top right to reveal them.</p>

<div id='osk-phone' data-states='default shift numeric symbol'>
</div>
