<h1>Yiddish/Hebrew</h1>

<p>This layout, useful for both Yiddish and Hebrew, is based on a design created by Mark David for UYIP which was based on the standard Hebrew keyboard used in Israel (which itself was created from earlier Yiddish typewriter keyboard layouts). A retrofited design which is of particular ease of use for those who are already proficient with a standard Israeli keyboard. This version was implemented for Keyman by Gyula Zsigri.</p>
