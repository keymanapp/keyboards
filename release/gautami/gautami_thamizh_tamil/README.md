Gautami Thamizh/Tamil keyboard
==============

Description
-----------
This is a QWERTY-based keyboard for Thamizh/Tamil with easy-to-remember key assignments suitable for beginners with limited knowledge of the Tamil writing system. It is phonetic: typing k will get you க. It is, however, not alphabetic. It follows the aksara-based Brahmi orthographic convention of omitting the implicit/inherent அ/ə/a in consonants. The Tamil word பகடி is typed as pkTi, not pakaTi.
