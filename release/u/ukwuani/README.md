Ukwuani Language Development Encyclopedia and Cultural Foundation has its Registered permanent office & training schools at No. 1, Onicha-Ukwuani road by Ogbagu Mixed Secondary School Ogbagu Ogume, Ndokwa-West LGA, Delta State, Nigeria.

Ukwuani language keyboard is developed to type Ukwuani Language using the right orthography of Ukwuani language. It is Latin based and additional characters added to the US standard Keyboard layout. They can be found in the AltGr (Right Alt) and Shift AltGr (Shift + Right Alt) on computer (i.e. Windows, macOS, Linux and web) and long presses of related keys on touch layers (i.e. Android and iOS devices).

In 2014, Ukwuani language was key among other languages that were considered among numerous languages that will go into extinction in no distant time. In addition to this, many Ukwuani's are very eager to communicate & write in Ukwuani but the keyboard available in their phones, laptops ...etc, are that of other languages, mostly Yoruba. Efforts were made to translate the holy bible from Genesis to the book of revelation, 100 Bible stories and many more in Ukwuani Language. The challenge in achieving all these is the fact that Ukwuani language orthography is so unique that the vowels, consonants, if not properly used, automatically connotes something different. Ukwuani Language Development, Encyclopedia and Cultural Foundation worked hard to break the jinx, networking with expert team of engineers within & outside Nigeria to produce Ukwuani language keyboard no matter the odds, costs and challenges. Before now, it has been so difficult to type Ukwuani language on Computer and other information technologies platforms due to the unique orthography as mentioned earlier. This major breakthrough in the development of Ukwuani language keyboard will facilitate the study of Ukwuani language from Nursery, Primary, Secondary, NCE, OND, HND, B.Sc/BA, M.Sc/ MA & PhD levels. The syllabi for all levels of studies in Ukwuani language have earlier been printed & documented. With the help of SIL Software Community in general and Mr. Makara in person, we were able to produce the Ukwuani language keyboard under Keyman platform. You may not see it written Ukwuani language keyboard on the source code. This Ukwuani language keyboard is licensed to Ukwuani Language Development Encyclopedia and Cultural Foundation.
