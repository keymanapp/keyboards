Death is an enemy when it comes to completion of tasks. With the death of the Pioneers who started Ukwuani Language development such as Ezinne Agnes Ikukaiwe, Chief Egri Okwaji & a host of others, God raised a team of Eagles that rose to the challenge of completing the task started by the Pioneers:</p>

The negative prophecy of Local and International Philosophers that Ukwuani Language shall soon go into extinction in no distant time should not be allowed to come to pass. This is a clarion call on Ukwuani's all over the world to support this project. All hands should be on deck. Ukwuani Language is unique and distinct from Ibo language or any other languages in the world because of the unique orthography & vowels. This Foundation is maintaining an Encyclopedia-- record of Ukwuani in all spheres of life (Politics, Medicine, Law, Local Government, State, Federal Administration, Herbal Medicine,, Construction, Civil Service, Organised Business Sector, Manufacturing, Education, Real Estate, etc) that made indelible mark and contributions to the development of Ukwuani nation. The time to prove our Ukwuaniness is now. Teaching and learning Ukwuani Language from Nursery Primary Secondary NCE OND HND B.Sc M.Sc & Ph.D level starts now. This Foundation shall take charge of training and certification at all stages.
