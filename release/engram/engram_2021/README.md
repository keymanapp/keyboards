# Arno's Engram_2021 keyboard layout

Engram_2021 is the first Engram keyboard layout optimized for comfortable 
and efficient touch typing in English created by [Arno Klein](https://arnoklein.info), 
based on legacy [open source code](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram-2021).

Letters are optimally arranged according to a scoring model that reflects 
ergonomics factors that promote reduction of lateral finger movements and 
increase in efficient typing of high-frequency letter pairs: 

                B Y O U   L D W V Z
                C I E A   H T S N Q
                G X J K   R M F P

Punctuation marks are logically grouped together in the middle columns 
(accessed by the Shift and R-Alt keys) and numbers are paired with mathematical 
and logic symbols (accessed by the Shift Key):

     [{ 1| 2= 3~ 4+  5<  6>  7^ 8& 9% 0* ]} /\
        bB yY oO uU  '(  ")  lL dD wW vV zZ #$ @`
