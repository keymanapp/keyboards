# Arno's Engram keyboard layout

Engram is optimized for comfortable and efficient touch typing in English 
created by [Arno Klein](https://arnoklein.info), 
with [open source code](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram)
to create other optimized key layouts.

Letters are optimally arranged according typing preference crowdsourced data-driven multi-objective optimization to reflect ergonomics factors that promote reduction 
of lateral finger movements and increase in efficient typing of high-frequency letter pairs: 

                B Y O U   D N G V Q
                H I A E   T R S C Z
                K J X W   M L F P

Punctuation marks are logically grouped together in the middle columns 
(accessed by the Shift and R-Alt keys) and numbers are paired with mathematical 
and logic symbols (accessed by the Shift Key):

     [{ 1| 2= 3~ 4+  5<  6>  7^ 8& 9% 0* ]} /\
        bB yY oO uU  '(  ")  dD nN gG vV qQ #$ @`
