<h1>Tuareg Tifinagh</h1>

<p> 
	Tuareg Tifinagh is designed for typing Tifinagh characters in the Tamahaq and Tamashek languages. 
	You can use this keyboard with any Tifinagh Unicode font. We highly recommend the Akatab font at 
	<a href="https://software.sil.org/akatab/" target=_blank>https://software.sil.org/akatab</a>. 
	This font has the required characters and bi-consonant ligatures for these languages.
	</p>
<p>
	It is based on the Standard Moroccan Tamazight Tifinagh AZERTY keyboard and 
	Microsoft's Central Atlas Tamazight (Tifinagh Extended) keyboard layout spec.
	Additional keys include the Tifinagh Consonant Joiner (U+2D7F) to create bi-consonant ligatures. 
	Also included are the Right to Left Override key (U+202E) for right to left writing and 
	POP Directional Formatting key (U+202C) to reverse the right to left writing.
