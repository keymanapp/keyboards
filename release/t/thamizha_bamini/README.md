Description
-----------

This keyboard, usually known as the Bamini layout, is designed for the Tamil language. 
It is originally based on a Tamil typewriter keyboard, and is used particularly in 
Sri Lanka. The keyboard is designed for users who are familiar with both this layout 
and the Tamil script, as consonants and vowels are typed in written order, and is 
intended for use with a normal QWERTY (English) keyboard.
