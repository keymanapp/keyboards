Tibetan EWTS Keyboard
=====================

Copyright (c) 2003-2019 SIL International

__DESCRIPTION__
Tibetan EWTS is based on the Extended Wylie Transliteration Scheme (EWTS), an approach to typing Tibetan which avoids most 
Shift, Alt, and Alt+Shift combinations. Tibetan characters are created from EWTS -transliteration each time you type a vowel 
or a Space (tsheg). Special rules apply for long-stacks. This keyboard also features special menus for Tibetan symbols.
