<p>This keyboard is for typing the Toto language in the Toto script. There are approximately 2000 speakers of the Toto language, living
on the Northern border of West Bengal, India. Dhaniram Toto designed
the characters of the Toto script. It was launched in May 2015
and in 2021 the characters of the script were accepted into the
Unicode standard.</p>
