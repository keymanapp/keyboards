Description
-----------

The Indonesian Basic layout (especially the default layer) contain letters, characters, symbols, that are frequently used in Indonesian context (Indonesian languages, and Indonesian country), and their placement/location should be justifiable.

The main difference with the US basic layout are:
 * The letters 'x' and 'q' are considered foreign, frequency wise very low, and can be replaced by 'k' and 'ks' respectively. Therefore they're moved/hidden to the letter 'z' (as longpress option and as combination, by typing 'zz', and 'zzz')
 ** In the place of 'x', substituted with 'é' (e-acute)
 ** In the place of 'q', substituted with 'è' (e-grave-accent) 
 ** Even though they're not found in Indonesian, but some words require clarification, e.g. kecap vs. kécap, seri vs. séri, and in Indonesia's largest language, Javanese.

The touch layout difference with the computer/physical keyboard layout:
 * 11 keys wide to accomodate portrait mode.
 * Moved all unused symbols, only place the necessary ones: '.', ',', '?', the 3 most used punctuations, '"', "(", ")", the other 3 often used punctuations, and "-" for Indonesian reduplication words (often abbreviated with a '2' symbol)
 ** Longpress for 1st row: 'è' takes the K_BKQUOTE symbols '`' and '~', 'w', 'e', and the rest takes the number and symbol row. Every key in this row has 2 longpress option
 ** Longpress for 'zxq': 'x' and 'q'
 ** Longpress for 5 symbol keys ',', '.', '?', '-', and '"', everyone has 3 longpress option, based on similarities and the base pairing.
 *** ',': '<', '[', '{' = the open bracket group
 *** '.': '>', ']', '}' = the closing bracket group
 *** '?': '/', '\', '|' = the slashes group
 *** '-': '_', '=', '+' = the mathematical notations
 *** '"': ''', ';', ':' = the quotes and colons
 * The shift layer correspond to the default layer's counterpart. For now there are 1 unassigned (blank) key. I'm open for ideas.
 * The numeric layer combines all numbers and symbols into one.

This is the result of questioning how we can improve the default qwerty keyboard that we are used to type with on physical keyboard, and optimize it for Indonesian language/user (especially on touch keyboard), instead of we adapting ourselves to English keyboard.

Some possible variations:
 * With numbers on top (5 rows)
 * Without numbers on top (4 rows)
 * With long press option (complex)
 * Without long press option (basic)
 * With support for all Indonesian languages (700+) that uses Latin script (no support for Cia-Cia language, for example)
 * Only support for Indonesian largest languages (Indonesian/Malay, Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, 7 Batak, Minang, Bugis, Aceh, Bali, Banjar), see https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daftar_bahasa_di_Indonesia
