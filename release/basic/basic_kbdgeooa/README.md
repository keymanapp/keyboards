 Known Issues
 -------------
 
 * `[SHIFT K_Z]` and `[SHIFT K_K]` produce the same output, `U+10B1`. It could potentially be a bug. `[SHIFT K_Z]` should give `U+10BF` (`GEORGIAN_CAPITAL_LETTER_JHAN`) which is the capital letter of `U+2D1F` (`GEORGIAN_SMALL_LETTER_JHAN`). (The touch layout has this fix.)
 * A number of keys are duplicate in the desktop layout, i.e. 
     * `U+10FB GEORGIAN_PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR` is found on both default and right alt layers.
	 * `U+0028 LEFT_PARENTHESIS` and `U+0029 RIGHT_PARENTHESIS` are found on both default and right alt layers.
	 * `U+003D EQUALS_SIGN` is found in both shift and right alt layers.
	 * `U+0021 EXCLAMATION_MARK` is found in both default and right alt layers.
	 * `U+00A7 SECTION_SIGN` is found in both shift and shift right alt layers.
