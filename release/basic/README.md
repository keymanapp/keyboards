The keyboards in this folder have all been imported from Windows 10, so the Keyman Desktop keyboard layout should 
match the Windows layout. However, mobile layouts have also been added to each of the keyboards.

These keyboards can be used as "starters" for other keyboards, but they should be renamed and the files 
should be renamed and put in the appropriate alphabetized folders. No keyboards for other projects 
should be added to "basic".
