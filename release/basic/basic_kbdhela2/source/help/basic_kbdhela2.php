<p>
This keyboard layout is designed for Greek.  It includes an on screen keyboard which can be 
viewed by clicking on the Keyman icon and selecting the On Screen Keyboard menu item. The 
keyboard layout follows the Windows 10 Greek (220) Latin layout.
</p>

<p>This keyboard makes use of "deadkeys" which are listed below:</p>

<p>΄ followed by space will produce ΄.</p>
<p>¨ followed by space will produce ¨.</p>
<p>΅ followed by space will produce ΅.</p>
<p>These deadkeys do not appear to do much. However, the keyboard layout is intended to match the Greek (220) layout.</p>
