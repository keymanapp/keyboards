<h2><span style="color: chocolate;">Indic Romanization from ITRANS</span> Keyboard Version 1.0.0</h2>
<p>This is a phonetic keyboard for Indic Romanization which is based on  
<strong><a href="https://www.aczoom.com/itrans/">ITRANS</a></strong> 
transliteration scheme with some modifications for input. 7bit ISO scheme
has also been referred to for modifying the input scheme. 
Accented letters used by various Indic Romanization schemes such as 
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15919">ISO</a></strong>, 
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration">IAST</a></strong>,
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Library_at_Kolkata_romanisation#Scheme_table">NLK</a></strong> 
 are supported for output. It also supports typing of IPA vowels for use in pronunciation keys.</p>

<p>The modified input scheme 
uses only lowercase letters. This allows the same letters to be typed
with SHIFT to get Unicode Romanized output in UPPERCASE letters, 
which is useful for typing Proper names, Headings, etc. </p>
