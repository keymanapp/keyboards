Shahmukhi Phonetic keyboard
==============

© SIL Global

Description
-----------

Shahmukhi is a modified Perso-Arab script for the Punjabi language. This keyboard intends to include support for characters not supported by the Urdu phonetics keyboard such as ArNoon (ݨ) and ArLaam (ࣇ U+08C7), (ਣ and ਲ਼ in Gurmukhi, respectively). ArLaam was added to Unicode recently and proper positioning may not work in all applications. The Scheherazade New font supports the ArLaam and is included in this keyboard package.

Shahmukhi Phonetic Keyman keyboard is based on a Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator keyboard developed 
by Sheikh Ahmed <technolical@gmail.com> for the Punjabi language.

This layout was used by permission of the author of the MSKLC keyboard layout called "Shahmukhi Phonetic 1.0.1 Keyboard".
