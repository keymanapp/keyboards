# Acknowledgments

This project incorporates a keyboard layout originally designed by Daniel Lesi≈Ñski from the Slaviature project [https://github.com/IS-UMK/Slaviature]. We would like to sincerely thank him for his valuable contribution to the development of this project.

We also wish to express our gratitude to Weronika Preinl for inspiring the idea of developing Slawiatura on the Keyman platform for keyboard creation and distribution. Her inspiration was instrumental in shaping the direction of this project.
