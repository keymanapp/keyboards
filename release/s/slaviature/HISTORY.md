## 1.1 (July 18, 2025)

- Removed the phone layout: The phone layout was redundant and is no longer
  needed. All necessary functionality is covered by the tablet layout.
- Fixed AltGr key visibility on the on-screen keyboard: The on-screen keyboard
  was not displaying keys for AltGr combinations. To resolve this, the element
  was added inside the section of the keyboard definition.
- Simplified README
- Updated Slaviature change history: The full development history has now been
  documented, starting from the Slaviature project initiation.
- Set keyboard name to Slaviature (capitalized) in the .kps file instead of the
  previous lowercase
