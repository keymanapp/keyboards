            The slp1_deva keyboard is one of two keyboards that are a part of The Sanskrit Library Phonetic ASCII package:
            one to enter Devanagari Unicode, the other to enter Roman Unicode
            with diacritics. These include all accents required for The R̥gveda.
            Both keymaps follow the Sanskrit Library ASCII encoding described in
            brief at https://sanskritlibrary.org/help-text.html, and in full in
            Linguistic Issues in Encoding Sanskrit, Appendix B available in a
            PDF linked to at the bottom of that webpage. The Romanization
            followed in the slp1_roman keyboard is ISO 15919 except e and o are
            represented as in IAST without the macron. Capital characters are
            obtained by wrapping the character sequence in curly brackets.
