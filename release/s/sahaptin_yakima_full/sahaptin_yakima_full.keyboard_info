    "description": "This project provides a desktop and on-screen keyboard that cancels English characters that are not shared with Ichishkiin and puts "special" characters (barred, accented, or back characters) into an ALT+ key combination. The glottal stop character is mapped onto the regular apostrophe key. It also provides a version of the mobile keyboard for both Android and iOS that features a full layout with all characters visible with "alternate" versions (accented and hard) on key-hold options. This is recommended for those either more familiar with smaller buttons or with a larger screen, on a phone or a tablet. Those with smaller screens or wanting larger buttons on a mobile keyboard should use the Condensed version."
