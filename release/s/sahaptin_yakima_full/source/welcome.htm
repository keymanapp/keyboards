<title>Sahaptin - Yakima Ichishkiin Full Keyboard</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Kw’ala nam wya´nawi!</h1>
<p>This keyboard is a great way to continue practicing and using your Ichishki´in S?´nwit.</p>
<p>A´wximash wa, congratulations!</p><br>
<h2>Computer Keyboard</h2>
<p>The desktop and laptop keyboard focuses on only Ichishki´in letters. Only letters shared with the Ichishki´in alphabet are going to be functional, so typing letters like "e", "g", etc., will not work.</p>
<p>Special characters, like accented vowels or barred characters (like l), will appear by holding the ALT key and pressing the button. Some keys have been repurposed: the barred ? letter (and accented version) will be accessible through the "o" button and the "ch" letter is mapped onto the "c" button, both of which do not exist on their own in Yakima Ichishkiin.</p>
<h2>Phone & Tablet Keyboard</h2>
<p>This version of the phone keyboard has a key button for every base letter, with slight modifications for accents or hard letters as long key-presses. If the keys are too small for your phone screen, the "Compact" version might be a better fit for your device.</p><br>
