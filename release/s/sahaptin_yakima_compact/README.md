Yakima Ichishkiin / Sahaptin Condensed Keyboard
=====================

Copyright (c) 2019 Keegan Livermore

Version 1.0

__DESCRIPTION__
This project provides a version of the mobile keyboard for both Android and iOS that features a condensed layout with base characters visible with more "alternate" versions (long, accented, and/or hard versions) on key-hold options. This is recommended for those either more familiar with the practical alphabet and typing on a phone or a tablet. Those with larger screens could use the Full version.
