<p>
    An adaptation of Shavian to another language, Esperanto, was developed by John Wesley Starling; though not widely used, at least one <a href="https://esperanto.us/sxava_alfabeto/">booklet</a> has been published with transliterated sample texts. As that language is already spelled phonemically, direct conversion from Latin to Shavian letters can be performed.
