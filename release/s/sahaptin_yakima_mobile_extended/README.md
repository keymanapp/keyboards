=====================

Version 1.0

__DESCRIPTION__
This project provides a version of the mobile keyboard for both Android and iOS that features a full layout with all characters visible with "alternate" versions (accented and hard) on key-hold options. This is recommended for those either more familiar with smaller buttons or with a larger screen, on a phone or a tablet. Those with smaller screens or wanting larger buttons on a mobile keyboard should use the Condensed version.
