<h1>Saraiki (Arabic) Keyboard</h1>

<p>
  This keyboard is for typing Saraiki with the Arabic script.
</p>

<p>
  The Saraiki keyboard is a helpful tool for users that know and use the 
  Saraiki language as well as the similar Urdu, Punjabi, Hindko and Balochi languages.
</p>

<p>
  The app comes as a keyboard layout that replaces the basic system language with Sakari, changing the characters to the symbols the language uses.
</p>

<p>
  Saraki is not a default language that can be changed from the Windows settings so a third-party app is required to make the changes. After the layout was changed, one should be able to apply the language to any text-based applications and platforms.
</p>


<p>
  A normal keyboard cannot hold the entire Saraiki character set, so the app seems to provide a way to reach more symbols by checking the Shift box from within the UI.
</p>

<p>
  To sum it up, Saraiki Keyboard might be a helpful tool for users that want to conduct their online works in the Saraki, Urdu, Punjabi, Balochi and Nastaâ€™liq languages. The Saraiki model can be previewed from within the provided app, so a user that has a hard time finding the symbols on their physical keyboard should have no issue in reading it.
