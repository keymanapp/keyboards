Description
-----------

Saraiki Keyboard is a helpful tool for users that know and use the Saraiki language as well as the similar Urdu, Punjabi, Hindko and Balochi languages.

The app comes as a keyboard layout that replaces the basic system language with Sakari, changing the characters to the symbols the language uses.

Saraki is not a default language that can be changed from the Windows settings so a third-party app is required to make the changes. After the layout was changed, one should be able to apply the language to any text-based applications and platforms.

A normal keyboard cannot hold the entire Saraiki character set, so the app seems to provide a way to reach more symbols by checking the Shift box from within the UI.

To sum it up, Saraiki Keyboard might be a helpful tool for users that want to conduct their online works in the Saraki, Urdu, Punjabi, Balochi and Nasta’liq languages. The Saraiki model can be previewed from within the provided app, so a user that has a hard time finding the symbols on their physical keyboard should have no issue in reading it.
