FONTLOG
Surma font for the Syloti Nagri script
======================================

This file provides detailed information on the Surma Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Surma font and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Surma is a TrueType Unicode font for the Syloti Nagri script. It uses OpenType and Graphite font technologies to achieve advanced typographic capabilities such as formation of conjuncts and the placement of combining marks.

The Surma font package does not include any keyboarding utilities. You will need to install an appropriate keyboard in order to enter data with this font. If no suitable keyboard is available, some tools for creating keyboards on Windows are Tavultesoft Keyman (keyman.com) or Microsoft MSKLC (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/goglobal/bb964665.aspx).
