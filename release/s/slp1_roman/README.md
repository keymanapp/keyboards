Sanskrit Library Phonetic ASCII (SLP1) (Sanskrit language)
==============

Description
-----------
The slp1_roman keyboard is one of two keyboards that are a part of The Sanskrit Library Phonetic ASCII package: one to enter Roman Unicode with diacritics, the other to enter Devanagari Unicode.  These include all accents required for The RÌ¥gveda.  Both keymaps follow the Sanskrit Library ASCII encoding described in brief at https://sanskritlibrary.org/help-text.html, and in full in Linguistic Issues in Encoding Sanskrit, Appendix B available in a PDF linked to at the bottom of that webpage.  The Romanization followed in the slp1_roman keyboard is ISO 15919 except e and o are represented as in IAST without the macron.  Capital characters are obtained by wrapping the character sequence in curly brackets.

This particular keyboard supports the Latin script.
