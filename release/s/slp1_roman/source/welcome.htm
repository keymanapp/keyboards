        <h1>Start Using slp1_roman</h1>

        <p>
            The slp1_roman keyboard is one of two keyboards that are a part of The Sanskrit Library Phonetic ASCII package:
            one to enter Roman Unicode with diacritics, the other to enter
            Devanagari Unicode. These include all accents required for The
            R̥gveda. Both keymaps follow the Sanskrit Library ASCII encoding
            described in brief at 
            <a href="https://sanskritlibrary.org/help-text.html">https://sanskritlibrary.org/help-text.html</a>            ,
            and in full in Linguistic Issues in Encoding Sanskrit, Appendix B
            available in a PDF linked to at the bottom of that webpage. The
            Romanization followed in the slp1_roman keyboard is ISO 15919 except
            e and o are represented as in IAST without the macron. Capital
            characters are obtained by wrapping the character sequence in curly
            brackets. Contacts: info@sanskritlibrary.org

        <p>This particular keyboard supports the Latin script.</p>
