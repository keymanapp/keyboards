        <p>
            The slp1_roman keyboard is one of two keyboards that are a part of The Sanskrit Library Phonetic ASCII package:
            one to enter Roman Unicode with diacritics, the other to enter
            Devanagari Unicode. These include all accents required for The
            RÌ¥gveda. Both keymaps follow the Sanskrit Library ASCII encoding
            described in brief at 
            <a href="https://sanskritlibrary.org/help-text.html">https://sanskritlibrary.org/help-text.html</a>,
            and in full in Linguistic Issues in Encoding Sanskrit, Appendix B
            available in a PDF linked to at the bottom of that webpage. The
            Romanization followed in the slp1_roman keyboard is ISO 15919 except
            e and o are represented as in IAST without the macron. Capital
            characters are obtained by wrapping the character sequence in curly
            brackets. Contacts: info@sanskritlibrary.org

        <p>This particular keyboard supports the Latin script.</p>
