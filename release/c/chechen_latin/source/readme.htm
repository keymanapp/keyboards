  <h3>
    Description
  </h3>
  <p>Chechen (Нохчийн мотт, Noxçiyn mott,[3] [ˈnɔxt͡ʃĩː mu͜ɔt]) is a Northeast Caucasian language spoken by 2 million
    people,
    mostly in the Chechen Republic and by members of the Chechen diaspora throughout Russia and the rest of Europe,
    Jordan,
    Central Asia (mainly Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan) and Georgia.</p>
  <p>Numerous inscriptions in the Georgian script are found in mountainous Chechnya, but they are not necessarily in
    Chechen.
    Later, the Arabic script was introduced for Chechen, along with Islam. The Chechen Arabic alphabet was first
    reformed
    during the reign of Imam Shamil, and then again in 1910, 1920 and 1922.</p>
  <p>At the same time, the alphabet devised by Peter von Uslar, consisting of Cyrillic, Latin, and Georgian letters, was
    used
    for academic purposes. In 1911 it too was reformed but never gained popularity among the Chechens themselves.</p>
  <p>The Latin alphabet was introduced in 1925. It was unified with Ingush in 1934, but abolished in 1938. In 1938–1992,
    only
    the Cyrillic alphabet was used for Chechen.</p>
  <p>The alphabet defined in this project was introduced in 1992 in the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.</p>
