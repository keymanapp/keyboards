  "description": "This keyboard layout is designed for typing the Coptic script. This English QWERTY-based keyboard layout is optimized for English-language typists. It is based on an English-specific transliteration and is probably going to be most popular with English-speaking Copticists. In order to fully access all the keys on this keyboards, you will need a keyboard (hardware) with 102 keys (US keyboards tend to only have 101 keys)."
