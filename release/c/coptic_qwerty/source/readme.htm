<h1>Coptic (Qwerty)</h1>

<p>
This keyboard layout is designed for typing the Coptic
script. This English QWERTY-based keyboard layout is 
optimized for English-language typists. It is based on an 
English-specific transliteration and is probably going to 
be most popular with English-speaking Copticists. 
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.evertype.com/fonts/coptic/" target="_blank">Antinoou</a> font was developed by the author of this keyboard and supports the standard Coptic characters. However, it does not yet support the Coptic Epact Numbers. The 
<a href="http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/" target="_blank">Symbola</a> font does include support for the Coptic Epact Numbers.</p>
