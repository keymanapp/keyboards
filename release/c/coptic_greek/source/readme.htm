<h1>Coptic (Greek)</h1>

<p>
This keyboard layout is designed for typing the Coptic
script. This keyboard is based on Apple's Greek keyboard 
layout. It is useful for people who type a lot of Greek 
and a little Coptic.
</p>
<p>In order to fully access all the keys on this keyboards, you will need a keyboard (hardware) with 102 keys (US keyboards tend to only have 101 keys).</p>

<p>Additionally, this keyboard makes use of SHIFT+RALT keys which are set by default when Keyman is installed. To use this keyboard, you must go to <b>Configuration.../Hotkeys</b> and select the hotkey for "Switch Keyman Desktop Off". Either change the hotkey or turn it off. Do the same for "Open Keyboard Menu" and for "Open Language Switcher".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.evertype.com/fonts/coptic/" target="_blank">Antinoou</a> font was developed by the author of this keyboard and supports the standard Coptic characters. However, it does not yet support the Coptic Epact Numbers. The 
<a href="http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/" target="_blank">Symbola</a> font does include support for the Coptic Epact Numbers. Because of licensing issues, neither of these fonts is included in this keyboard package.</p>
