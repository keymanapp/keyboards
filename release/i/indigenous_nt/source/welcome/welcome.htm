<h1>Indigenous NT Integrated Keyboard for Keyman</h1>

<p>This is the Keyman version of the universal keyboard for the 11 official languages of the Northwest Territories (Inuktitut in Roman Orthography). Additional characters for other circumpolar languages have also been included.</p>


<h2>Desktop Computers</h2>

<p>On Desktop computers, it retains the standard US keyboard layout while providing access to special characters and diacritics through the <strong>Alt-Gr (Alt-right)</strong> key on Desktop computers (<strong>right-Option</strong> key on Macs).</p>

<h2>Tablets and Mobiles</h2>

<p>On mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, the standard iOS keyboard layers for letters and numbers have been retained with the addition of an <strong>Alt</strong> key that provides access to the full range of combined diacritic bearing characters used in Northern Indigenous languages. </p>

<table width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td width="50%;"><img style="width: 100%;" src="layer-default.png"></td>
		<td width="50%;"><img style="width: 100%;" src="layer-alt.png"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The characters can also be accessed through the longpress popup on relevant letter keys (i.e., "g" for the glottal stop [ɂ], and "l" for the l with stroke [ł]).</p>

<table width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td width="25%;"></td>
		<td width="50%;"><img style="width: 100%;" src="layer-longpress.png"></td>
		<td width="25%;"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The keyboard is intended to be intuitive and easy to use for the widest number of users. As such, it hopes to facilitate widescale acceptance and adoption of the incredible linguistic diversity in the Canadian North.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>This keyboard defines some keys that are set by default as "hotkeys" when Keyman is installed.  To use this keyboard, you will want to go to <b>Configuration.../Hotkeys</b>, select the hotkey name, and either change the hotkey or turn it off.</p>

<p>Currently "Switch Keyman Desktop Off" uses <strong>Shift+Alt+O</strong> and<br/>
"Open Keyboard Menu" uses <strong>Shift+Alt+M</strong>.</p>
