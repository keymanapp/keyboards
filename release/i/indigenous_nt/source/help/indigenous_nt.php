<h1>Indigenous NT Integrated Keyboard for Keyman</h1>

<p><small>By Rajiv Rawat</small></p>

<p>This is the Keyman version of the universal keyboard for the 11 official languages of the Northwest Territories (Inuktitut in Roman Orthography). Additional characters for other circumpolar languages have also been included.</p>

<p>The keyboard is intended to reduce keyboard switching and be intuitive and easy to use for the widest number of users. As such, it hopes to facilitate widescale acceptance and adoption of the incredible linguistic diversity in the Canadian North.</p>

<h2>Desktop Computers</h2>

<p>On Desktop computers, it retains the standard US keyboard layout while providing access to special characters and diacritics through the <strong>Alt-Gr (Right Alt)</strong> key on Desktop computers (right-Option key in Macs).</p>

<p>Note that the diacritics are typed after the vowel as in the Vowel First Dene convention.</p>

<h2>Tablets and Mobiles</h2>

<p>On mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, the standard iOS keyboard layers for letters and numbers have been retained with the addition of an <strong>Alt</strong> key that provides access to the full range of combined diacritic bearing characters used in Northern Indigenous languages. </p>

<p>The characters can also be accessed through the longpress popup on relevant letter keys.</p>

<p>This keyboard defines some keys that are set by default as "hotkeys" when Keyman is installed.  To use this keyboard, you will want to go to <b>Configuration.../Hotkeys</b>, select the hotkey name, and either change the hotkey or turn it off.</p>

<p>Currently "Switch Keyman Desktop Off" uses <strong>Shift+Alt+O</strong> and<br/>
"Open Keyboard Menu" uses <strong>Shift+Alt+M</strong>.</p>
