	The Dega Keyboard is a remarkable innovation with a singular purpose: to support the indigenous communities of Vietnam's Central Highlands in preserving their unique scripts and languages. Crafted to meet the diverse needs of ethnic groups like Êđê, Jơrai, Kơ’Ho, Mơnông, Bahnar, and many others, this keyboard is designed for simplicity, speed, and unmatched convenience when it comes to document writing.

<p>
What truly sets the Dega Keyboard apart is its user-friendly interface and the seamless typing experience it offers. Perhaps the best part is that it's available to everyone free of charge. This means that the rich cultural heritage of these indigenous communities can continue to thrive and be accessible to future generations.
