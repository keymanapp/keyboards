Todo
----

* Fill in the blanks in this README.md file:
  * Fill in a description of the keyboard
  * Fill in the Links information (or delete the line if it doesn't apply)
  * Delete any platforms under the "Supported Platforms" section that your keyboard files do not support. The result should agree with the "store(&TARGETS)" information in the .kmn file. (If "store(&TARGETS)" is "any", then leave all the platforms in the list.)

* Rename the template.keyboard_info file to match your project name (project_name + ".keyboard_info" extension), for example "inuktitut_latin.keyboard_info" for the "inuktitut_latin" keyboard.
  * Complete the information in the .keyboard_info file by filling in data for "language" and "description".
  * if this keyboard supports more than one language, separate the codes with commas: "zzz", "qqq" and place each on a separate line
  * supply a meaningful description for the keyboard; this description will be what website visitors will see when they view the keyboard details and on which they can search
* This should cover many cases, but if the keyboard is more complicated, see: https://help.keyman.com/developer/cloud/keyboard_info/1.0/ for more details of what can be included in the .keyboard_info file, and for examples.
* Finally, remove these TODO items from this file once you have completed them!
