==============

Description
-----------

The Himyarit Musnad keyboard supports the entry of Musnad Script
which is also commonly referred to as “Old South Arabian” and “Sabaean”
or “Himyarit” script by different communities. Musnad and the languages
that used it continue to be important to the studies of Semitic
languages. Musnad was written in either the boustrophedon style of
writing or in the right-to-left direction. The keyboard is agnostic to
the writing direction and leaves it to the editor application to control
the direction of text.


Included Fonts
--------------
The “Musnad” fonts were developed by Dr. Sultan Al-Maqtari who won the
first place prize for texts at the International Competition for the Design of
Typefaces in Dubai (2006). Dr. Sultan then worked for the inclusion of Musnad
in the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set standard (aka U“nicode”) with the
support of Kamal Mansour and the University of California, Berkley, Department of 
Languages (<a href="https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n3309.pdf">Ref 1</a>,
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n3395.pdf">Ref 2</a>).


The “Qataban” font included with this archive was developed by
Dr. Bronson Brown-deVost (Bronson.Brown-deVost@theologie.uni-goettingen.de)
and made available under the OpenFont License (OFL). The Qatalan glyphs assume
the right-to-left direction a future revision is expected to provide the
left-to-right versions of relevant glyphs available through a stylistic
set.
