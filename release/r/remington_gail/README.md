Remington GAIL (SIL) keyboard
==============

Â© SIL International

Description
-----------

This keyboard is an implementation of the Remington-GAIL typewriter layout for 
inputting Unicode-compliant Devanagari. The layout was designed for Hindi input, 
but may suffice for other Devanagari script based languages. It faithfully 
implements the default and Shift keys of the legacy Remington-GAIL layout on a 
standard QWERTY keyboard. It also provides a number of additional characters 
from the APS Saral layout using the AltGr (Right Alt) and AltGR+Shift key modifiers.
