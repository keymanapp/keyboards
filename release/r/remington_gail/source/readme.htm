<h1>Remington GAIL (SIL)</h1>

<p>This keyboard is an implementation
of the Remington-GAIL typewriter layout for inputting Unicode-compliant Devanagari.
The layout was designed for Hindi input, but may suffice for other Devanagari
script based languages. It faithfully implements the default and Shift keys of
the legacy Remington-GAIL layout on a standard QWERTY keyboard. It also
provides a number of additional characters from the APS Saral layout using the
AltGr (Right Alt) and AltGR+Shift key modifiers.</p>
<p>This keyboard was developed to fill the gap provided by two IMEs (APS Saral Hindi Indic Input 3 by Webdunia) and which are no longer supported on Windows and not available on other OSes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>APS Saral</li>
  <li> Hindi Indic Input 3 </li>
</ul>
