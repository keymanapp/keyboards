FirstVoices Keyboard Package
==================================================

(c) 2015-2024 FirstVoices, SIL International, 2015 First Peoples' Cultural Foundation

__DESCRIPTION__

This package includes all the FirstVoices keyboards for Windows, Android, and iOS. It is distributed as part of the FirstVoices project.

Note that the package will not be listed under the languages included in the package on keyman.com, as we have 
excluded them from the .keyboard_info. This is intentional: the package is included as a convenience for the distribution
of the FirstVoices keyboards standalone on Windows.

### Note for keyboard maintainers:
* The fv_all keyboard package version is maintained in /source/fv_all.kps.in
* When adding new keyboards to fv_all, the [keyboards.csv](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/master/oem/firstvoices/keyboards.csv) 
file in the Keyman repo also needs to get updated for the FirstVoices mobile apps to know what Region and Language ID to associate with the keyboard.
