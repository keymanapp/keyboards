FirstVoices Keyboard Package

Version 12.3

__DESCRIPTION__

This package includes all the FirstVoices keyboards for Windows, Android, and iOS. It is distributed as part of the FirstVoices project.

Note that the package will not be listed under the languages included in the package on keyman.com, as we have 
excluded them from the .keyboard_info. This is intentional: the package is included as a convenience for the distribution
of the FirstVoices keyboards standalone on Windows.
