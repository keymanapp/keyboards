# Arno's Engram key layout

Engram is a key layout optimized for comfortable and efficient touch typing in English 
created by [Arno Klein](https://binarybottle.com), 
with [open source code](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram) to create other optimized key layouts.

Letters are optimally arranged according to a scoring model that reflects ergonomics factors that promote reduction of lateral finger movements and increase in efficient typing of high-frequency letter pairs: 

                B Y O U   L D W V Z
                C I E A   H T S N Q
                G X J K   R M F P

Punctuation marks are logically grouped together in the middle columns (accessed by the Shift and R-Alt keys) and numbers are paired with mathematical and logic symbols (accessed by the Shift Key):

     [{ 1| 2= 3~ 4+  5<  6>  7^ 8& 9% 0* ]} /\
        bB yY oO uU  '(  ")  lL dD wW vV zZ #$ @`
