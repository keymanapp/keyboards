# Arno's Engram key layout

Engram is a key layout optimized for comfortable and efficient touch typing in English 
created by [Arno Klein](https://binarybottle.com), 
with [open source code](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram) to create other optimized key layouts.

Letters are optimally arranged according to a scoring model that reflects ergonomics factors that promote reduction of lateral finger movements and increase in efficient typing of high-frequency letter pairs: 

            Y  P  O  X           F  C  M  W  Q 
            H  I  E  A           T  S  N  R  Z      
            G  K  J  U           D  V  B  L             

Punctuation marks are logically grouped together in the middle columns (accessed by the Shift and R-Alt keys) and numbers are paired with mathematical and logic symbols (accessed by the Shift Key):

         [{ 1| 2= 3~ 4+  5<  6>  7^ 8& 9% 0* ]} /\
