Letters are optimally arranged to reduce lateral finger movements, following ergonomic principles, and facilitating high-frequency letter pairs. Punctuation marks are grouped together in the middle columns (accessed by the Shift and Ctrl keys) and numbers are paired with symbols that resemble them (accessed by the Shift Key):

          ~  |  =  <  +   $    @   >  &  %  *  `
          #  1  2  3  4   5    6   7  8  9  0  ^
