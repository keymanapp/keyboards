# Arno's Engram key layout

Engram is a key layout optimized for comfortable and efficient touch typing in English 
created by [Arno Klein](https://binarybottle.com), 
with [open source code](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram) to create other optimized key layouts.
You can install the Engram layout on [Windows, macOS, and Linux](https://keyman.com/keyboards/engram)
or [try it out online](https://keymanweb.com/#en,Keyboard_engram).

Letters are optimally arranged according to a scoring model that reflects ergonomic factors that promote reduction of lateral finger movements and increase in efficient typing of high-frequency letter pairs. This arrangement received the highest score of over 200 million different key-letter combinations: 

             Y  G  U  K            B  L  D  F  Q 
             I  O  E  A            R  T  S  N  J
             V  Z  X  C            H  W  P  M

Punctuation marks are logically grouped together in the middle columns (accessed by the Shift and Crl+Alt keys) and numbers are paired with mathematical and logic symbols (accessed by the Shift Key):

          $  -  =  ~  +   <    >   /  &  %  *  ^  `
          #  1  2  3  4   5    6   7  8  9  0  |  \

             Y  G  U  K  ([{  )]}  B  L  D  F  Q
             I  O  E  A  ,;:  .?!  R  T  S  N  J      
             V  Z  X  C  "#@  '-_  H  W  P  M
