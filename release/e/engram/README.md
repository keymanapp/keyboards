# Arno's Engram key layout

Engram is a key layout optimized for comfortable and efficient touch typing in English 
created by [Arno Klein](https://binarybottle.com), 
with [open source code](https://github.com/binarybottle/engram) to create other optimized key layouts.

Letters are optimally arranged according to a scoring model that reflects ergonomic factors that promote reduction of lateral finger movements and increase in efficient typing of high-frequency letter pairs: 

                 Y  O  U  X    W  D  C  V  Q 
                 I  H  E  A    R  T  S  N  Z      
                 P  K  J  G    L  B  F  M             

Punctuation marks are logically grouped together in the middle columns (accessed by the Shift and R-Alt keys) and numbers are paired with mathematical and logic symbols (accessed by the Shift Key):

          $  -  =  ~  +   <    >   /  &  %  *  ^  `
          #  1  2  3  4   5    6   7  8  9  0  |  \

             Y  O  U  X  ([{  )]}  W  D  C  V  Q 
             I  H  E  A  ,;:  .?!  R  T  S  N  Z      
             P  K  J  G  "#@  '-_  L  B  F  M
