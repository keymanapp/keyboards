<h1>Shaw Imperial</h1>

<p>

A Keyman keyboard to allow users to type the English language in the Shavian alphabet. The Shavian alphabet is an alternative, phonemic way to write English. The alphabet takes its name from Irish writer Bernard Shaw who inspired and posthumously funded it. Shaw believed there should be a simpler way to write English. His wish was fulfilled in 1962 following a worldwide competition. The winner of that competition, Kingsley Read, developed an alphabet designed especially for English, with a unique letter for each of the 40 or so basic sounds we all use today.

Shaw Imperial is inspired by the Shavian Imperial Good Companion typewriter layout, and named in honour of it.
