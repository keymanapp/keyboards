<h1>Shaw JAFL | 𐑖𐑷 𐑡𐑨𐑓𐑩𐑤</h1>

<p>

A Keyman keyboard to allow users to type the English language in the Shavian alphabet. The Shavian alphabet is an alternative, phonemic way to write English. The alphabet takes its name from Irish writer Bernard Shaw who inspired and posthumously funded it. Shaw believed there should be a simpler way to write English. His wish was fulfilled in 1962 following a worldwide competition. The winner of that competition, Kingsley Read, developed an alphabet designed especially for English, with a unique letter for each of the 40 or so basic sounds we all use today.

The Shaw JAFL keyboard layout, or 𐑖𐑷 𐑡𐑨𐑓𐑩𐑤 in Shavian, was developed from scratch by Shavian.info using <a href="https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/">carpalx</a> to minimise typing effort when using the Shavian alphabet. This is achieved by placing more frequently typed letters in the home row and ensuring that letters frequently typed together may are placed to minimise effort.

Shaw JAFL is unusual in that it takes advantage of Keyman's ability to compose letters from other combinations. In the case of Shavian, this permits the compound letters to be typed using their component parts, reducing the number of keys required.

We are currently blessed with many different Shavian keyboard layouts and the name Shaw JAFL is derived from &lsquo;just another &ldquo;fabulous&rdquo; layout&rsquo;.
