  This keyboard is designed for typing Behdini Kurdish in the Arabic script. It is loosely based on a standard Arabic keyboard layout. Some characters from a standard Arabic keyboard that are not required by Behdini Kurdish have been added to the right-alt keyboard layers.
</p>
<p>The font distributed with this version of the keyboard is named <b>Scheherazade New Kurd</b>. In previous version of this keyboard a font was included called <b>Scheherazade New kmr</b>. You may wish to uninstall the <b>Scheherazade New kmr</b> font. </p>
