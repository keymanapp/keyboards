<p>
This keyboard is designed for typing Behdini Kurdish in the Arabic script. It is loosely based on a standard Arabic keyboard layout. Some characters from a standard Arabic keyboard that are not required by Behdini Kurdish have been added to the right-alt keyboard layers.

<h2>Desktop Keyboard Layout</h2>

  <p>There are a few keys which are only available through two keystrokes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>SHIFT+M</b> produces &#x2018;, and pressing <b>SHIFT+M</b> a second time will produce &#x201C;</li>
  <li><b>SHIFT+U</b> produces &#x2019;, and pressing <b>SHIFT+U</b> a second time will produce &#x201D;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mobile/Tablet Keyboard Layout</h2>
<p>Due to the size and number of keys, some characters are hidden in the long press. 
	Press and hold on the key with a little dot on the top right to reveal and use them.</p>
