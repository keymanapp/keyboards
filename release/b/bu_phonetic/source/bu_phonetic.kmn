c 2) This keyboard supports both Windows ANSI applications (8-bit encoding) as well as Unicode applications.  In 
c     several places in the code below, separate stores need to be set up for ANSI data, and there is a separate 
c     ANSI group that invokes them.  (ANSI-related items have "-A" at the end of their name.)                                                  
c     This means that changes made in the Unicode stores and group, if relevant to an ANSI keyboard, also need to
c     be made in corresponding ANSI stores and the ANSI group, and that both keyboards should be tested independently.

c 3) If you want to modify anything that has to do with saltillo (dotless exclamation) or acute accent,
c    study the code carefully first, as these two are tricky.  Two issues are involved:  
c    a') As of 2006-05-16, saltillo is output using the PUA character, not as described below.
c    a) Currently, this keyboard outputs a fudge for saltillo in Unicode (U+02C8) as well as in ANSI ('), since 
c       the proposal to have this character added to Unicode has not yet been accepted.  There is a PUA character for it 
c       in Doulos SIL and Charis SIL (U+F21D), but not other fonts, and even in the SIL fonts may give problems with behavior.  
c       Because this character is so widely-used in the Mexico branch of SIL, the branch has decided to use 
c       U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE for now rather than the SIL-PUA character, except 
c       when high-quality output is required.  Similarly, for ANSI applications, this keyboard is set up to encode saltillo 
c       as a straight apostrophe.  If you want to use a different character for saltillo, edit the stores named 
c       "saltillo", which are defined below at "PATCH AREA acute and saltillo".  Do not just search the code 
c       for U+02C8 and replace it with something else; other instances of U+02C8 are for representing 
c       stress, and should remain as U+02C8, regardless of how you want to represent saltillo.
c    b) You may prefer to use apostrophe to type acute accent rather than CTRL+apostrophe.  Some people may also 
c       want to use apostrophe to type saltillo, and there is an easy way 
c       to enable this below (search for "PATCH AREA saltillo").  However, these two uses can conflict
c       following a vowel.  For example, if users type the sequence a'' they should end up with "a" plus
c       saltillo, not "a" plus apostrophe.  Otherwise, they will likely be introducing a mixture
c       of saltillos and apostrophes in their data rather than consistently entering saltillos.
c       The way to avoid this problem is explained below; seach for "nrmlRsltAcute".

c 4) If you want to disable trigger keys that you don't need, redefine them, or define new
c    ones; see the detailed instructions at "PATCH AREA trigger keys".

c 5) To add a new character or combination of base character and diacritic, many times all you need to do 
c    is add it to the appropriate pair of stores (e.g. store(baseAcute) and store(Acute)).  Other times,
c    you may need to add other lines of code or even a new trigger key.  If so, study existing code carefully;
c    I suggest you do most of your modifications by copying and pasting existing code, then adjusting the details.

c 6) To change an existing character, be sure to search for its codepoint throughout the source code, because some characters can be
c    generated in more than one way and thus appear in more than one place in the source code.

c 7) There *may* be SIL PUA characters that are generated by the Unicode sections this keyboard.  Once we get
c    official Unicode codepoints for them, they should be changed (and, of course, any data previously typed 
c    with this keyboard will need to be converted).  You can find them, if they are present, by searching for instances of 
c    "U+E" and "U+F".

c PATCH AREA trigger keys

c These stores are used to simplify modifications of the keyboard for 
c people who prefer different keystroke combinations. It also provides 
c an overview of the most important trigger keys and what they are used for. 
c (There are a few additional trigger keys scattered through the code which are only used in a small number of combinations.)

c I. Each of the stores for trigger keys should contain only a single keystroke.  If you want to use the same key for two 
c    different purposes, test carefully to make sure there are no conflicts.  Especially for diacritic trigger keys, avoid this, 
c    even if trigger key A is only used with keyDiac and trigger key B may be used without it, because there are times when
c    trigger key B may also need to be typed with keyDiac (e.g., to place the diacritic on no-break space).

c II. To disable a trigger key, thus eliminating a whole class of changes, don't just leave the 
c   store for the trigger key empty (the keyboard may not compile), and definitely don't comment it out.  
c   The best thing to do is to specify some key that is extremely unlikely to be typed, such as [K_?FF], 
c   which represents an unknown keycode that probably never occurs on any hardware keyboard nor is ever used 
c   by any application.  For example, the following line will disable all macron vowels:
c       store(keyMacron)   [K_?FF]

c III. To add a new trigger key for a previously unsupported diacritic, you also need to make changes
c   in several other places.  You should check the following:
c     PATCH AREA all diacritics     (to enable keyDiac sequences and configure proper behavior after space)
c     PATCH AREA baseCom            
c     PATCH AREA individual diacritics
c   Study the code carefully in those places to see what is needed, as well as the rest of these initial instructional comments.  
c   I suggest that as you add lines of code for new diacritics, you maintain the convention of keeping diacritics in order 
c   within each section according to their Unicode codepoint.

c IV. For new trigger keys that don't produce diacritics but rather change one character into another, there are similar  
c   adjustments to make in the code but fewer than for diacritics; search for the store "IPA" or "baseIPA" to see how this is done.

c V. There are different categories of trigger keys, which vary on two independent dimensions.  If you change a trigger key
c   in either of these ways, you will need to adjust code at several places.
c   A. Some trigger keys are "visible", that is, in their normal use, they produce a printable character.  Others are
c      "invisible", in other words, combinations of CTRL and/or ALT.  
c   B. For diacritics, some trigger keys only have meaning as trigger keys following keyDiac; when used alone they have no 
c      special significance.  These tend to be for rarer diacritics.  (Many of these also have visible trigger keys, but possibly not all.)  
c      These should be identified with comments in the store definitions below.  
c      Other diacritic trigger keys are usually used by themselves, although they may be optionally
c      preceded by keyDiac (and if so, will force a diacritic into a context that might not otherwise accept it).

c V. If you want to use visible trigger keys for diacritics that will (at least some of the time)
c   be represented with combining marks, and if those trigger keys will typically be used 
c   without keyDiac, then you should set up a baseCom_(diacritic)_ store for those
c   base characters that can accept the diacritic as a combining mark.
c   The reason is that we only want the trigger key to be translated to a combining mark following certain characters;
c   in other places, the key (when used without keyDiac) should introduce a composite character or just be inserted without translation.
c   Then, you should use the baseCom_(diacritic)_ store in the "PATCH AREA individual diacritics".  Depending on the diacritic, 
c   you may need to do this in the ANSI group as well as in the Unicode group.
c   See further discussion and explanation below under "PATCH AREA baseCom" and "PATCH AREA individual diacritics".   

c VI. If you want to use invisible trigger keys, there are several things to remember:
c
c a. Invisible trigger keys only work when they are typed after the character they modify.  (Either
c    that, or you you'd have to modify the code more extensively so an invisible trigger key typed before was treated as a deadkey,
c    because you wouldn't want the invisible trigger key to sneak through to the application and cause havoc before the user has 
c    a chance to type the next key.)
c
c b. Don't use invisible keys that are likely to have special meaning in applications; you'll make those functions inaccessible.  
c    Thus, it is best to avoid function keys or any combination with CTRL or ALT that involves a letter.  
c    ALT+? should not be used because this calls up the help menu on some non-English versions of applications.
c    Word uses a few important CTRL and ALT combinations with SPACE, ENTER, HYPHEN, and UNDERLINE, so also avoid these.
c
c c. Code the trigger key as a virtual character key whenever one is available, not a virtual key, since this is a 
c    mnemonic keyboard (new feature in version 6.0 of Keyman).  For example, use [CTRL "\"] rather than [CTRL K_BKSLASH].
c    If you use a virtual key, TIKE will warn you about this when you compile the keyboard.
c    I anticipate that the result will not work as expected if the underlying Windows keyboard is anything 
c    other than the default U.S. keyboard, but I haven't tested it yet.  Virtual keys, however, can be used if there is no 
c    corresponding virtual character key. Thus, for example, [CTRL ALT K_LEFT] could be used as a trigger key.
c
c d. Test the CTRL or ALT combination, to make sure the trigger key is never sent through to the 
c    application.  If it does get through, it may produce strange results such as 
c    moving the cursor, deleting text, activating a menu, or blocking subsequent key translations.  
c    To avoid these problems, at various places, the code for invisible trigger keys is different 
c    from the code for visible trigger keys.  See the following PATCH AREAs for more details:
c      PATCH AREA all diacritics
c      PATCH AREA baseCom
c      PATCH AREA individual diacritics
c
c    One quick way to tell if you are going to have problems is to test the CTRL or ALT trigger key in TIKE.  
c    If, when you press the trigger key several times, the base character simply toggles back and forth
c    between the ordinary and special characters or generates a beep, then there should be no problem.  
c    The trigger key is not being sent to the output. If, after 1 or 2 repretitions, further presses of the trigger key cause no 
c    further changes or beeps, then this means the trigger key is being put in the context (and thus passed through to 
c    the output) and this will likely cause problems in some applications.  If so, investigate the PATCH AREAs
c    listed above.

c VII. With regard to keyDiac sequences for typing diacritics:
c    A. Having keyDiac available in the keyboard makes it much more feasible to use visible characters as trigger keys.
c       Most of the diacritics which have visible trigger keys require the use of keyDiac, and most of the diacritics
c       which require keyDiac have visible trigger keys.
c    B. If a trigger key is used with keyDiac, then it should have no distinct use as a trigger when typed by itself.  It
c       may generate the same diacritic by itself, or (as a visible key) generate its normal character, but not 
c       anything else.  This is necessary in order to preserve a consistent pattern of usage for keyDiac. If the trigger
c       key has its special meaning only when used with keyDiac, this should be noted in a comment by its definition.
c    C. Do not include the keyDiac key in any other store, even for those trigger keys that always require you to type 
c       it. This is a special case of the requirement that each trigger key store be a single character. 
c       The sequences of keyDiac plus diacritic trigger key are all handled elsewhere in the code.  
c    D. If you want to change a diacritic from always using keyDiac to optionally 
c       using it or vice versa, you will need to add, subtract, or modify lines of code at other places, such as:
c           in this section, add or delete a comment that indicates that the trigger key is only used with keyDiac
c           PATCH AREA individual diacritics: add or delete lines that use keyDiac in combination with the trigger key
c           the corresponding portions of the ANSI group, if relevant
c       How to do this is not well described in the comments, because I don't anticipate that it will be necessary
c       very often.  If necessary, study the examples in those places carefully to see how this is handled.

c A few trigger keys are used before a single character
c (These must be visible trigger keys, not invisible.)
store(keyDiac)          "%"         c following key is a diacritic 
                                    c Required preceding trigger characters for rare diacritics, optional otherwise.
                                    c When optional, its use 
                                    c a) always invokes a diacritic, even on base characters that
                                    c    don't normally take that diacritic, see "PATCH AREA baseCom" below, 
                                    c b) is normally required for typing diacritics in isolation, i.e. on a no-break space
                                    c c) allows stacking of two instances of the same diacritic, for what it's worth.

c Most trigger keys are typed after one or more base characters.
store(keyRaised)        [CTRL "^"]              c raised (superscript) characters
store(keyLowered)       [CTRL SHIFT "^"]        c lowered (subscript) characters
store(keyLarger)        [CTRL ALT "^"]          c make character larger without shifting vertically

store(keyLig)           "&"                     c ligatures and other combinations of 2 or more characters, 
                                                c where the joining doesn't happen automatically

c Stores that summarize all the diacritics and their trigger keys
c PATCH AREA all diacritics
c (This section is not relevant to the ANSI keyboard for now, but may be needed to implement diacritics in isolation.)  
c
c There are two purposes for the stores in this section:
c
c 1) Every trigger key used for a diacritic needs to be included in the DiacTrig store, and the corresponding diacritic itself 
c   (usually a combining mark) must be included in the Diac store.  This (in combination with later code) is what causes 
c   the sequence of keyDiac plus diacritic trigger key to be transformed to the combining mark.
c 
c 2) Combining marks should be blocked from being introduced in certain contexts, 
c   such as after space and newline.  To do this, diacritics with visible trigger keys need to be distinguished here from 
c   those that have invisible trigger keys.  (Code elsewhere discards the invisible ones in these contexts and 
c   makes sure the visible ones only generate their ordinary character rather than a combining mark.)
c
c So, the following store definitions are in two major clumps, depending on whether they have visible trigger keys,
c then they are joined together at the end.

c   outs(keyDblAcute) outs(keyDblGrave)
c   U+030B            U+030F
c
c Now put everything together for use with keyDiac
store(DiacTrig) outs(VisibleTrigger) outs(InvisibleTrigger)
store(CombMark) outs(Diac4VisTrig)   outs(Diac4InvTrig)     

c Because of the above code and the way the keyDiac key is handled in the Unicode group, 
c almost all keyDiac sequences generate combining marks, even if typing the trigger key without keyDiac
c produces a composite.  To change this behavior generally, we would have to move all the code for assembling composites 
c to a separate group, and its not clear that that's a good idea (see discussion in "BU Enhancements.doc").  In the meantime, if you 
c need a keyDiac sequence to generate a composite character, then see "PATCH AREA individual diacritics"; there needs to be 
c a separate line of code added to that section for each combination of keyDiac plus a diacritic trigger key that should generate composites.  
c 
c And, of course, you will also need to make sure there are base_(diacritic)_ and _(diacritic)_ stores at "PATCH AREA composite".

c cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
c cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc

c Miscellaneous codes referring to individual characters or small groups of them

c Several of these need to be defined before the general stores, which make reference to them, 
c but after the trigger keys for diacritics are defined.
                    
c Special handling for dotless exclamation ("saltillo") and acute accent
c PATCH AREA acute and saltillo
c See also discussion above in the warnings about how to modify the keyboard, and code below for 2nd keypress on acute accent.
c Codepoints to use to represent dotless exclamation (enlarged straight apostrophe, "saltillo")
store(saltillo)    U+F21D   c Unicode: Use U+F21D from the private use area in SIL Doulos and SIL Charis
c store(saltillo)    U+02C8   c Unicode: Use U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE as a fudge until dotless exclamation gets added
store(saltillo-A)  "'"      c ANSI: Use straight apostrophe; alternately could use the SIL-Mexico "standard" custom codepoint xDF (normally 'ß')
    
c What normally results from typing the trigger key for acute accent (i.e. when it doesn't get translated to acute).
c   Because some users may want to use ordinary apostrophe as a trigger key for both acute and for saltillo,
c   we need a store to indicate what keyAcute produces when it is used by itself (i.e. when it is translated to saltillo).
c   This is because typing keyAcute a 2nd time should produce the vowel plus what that key normally produces by itself, not following a vowel.
c 
c nrmlRsltAcute should be:
c   if the same visible character (most likely apostrophe) is used for both acute accent and saltillo, use outs(saltillo)
c   otherwise use outs(keyAcute)  
store(nrmlRsltAcute) outs(keyAcute)
c If keyAcute is an invisible trigger, then this store is never used.
c But, leave the line here; it is harmless and makes modifications to the keyboard easier.

c Others
store(nbsp) U+00A0          c non-breaking space
store(FracSlash) '/'        c character to be used for the slash in fractions, typically either '/' or U+2044 FRACTION SLASH
                            c At least in Doulos SIL, the ordinary slash looks better.

c stores for composite base+diacritic characters 
c PATCH AREA composite 

c This section lists the base characters that should be transformed into composites by the diacritic trigger keys.
c Each diacritic has a base_(diacritic)_ store indicating the base characters to which it can be added, and a 
c _(diacritic)_ store containing the corresponding composite characters.

c Different base stores are required for each diacritic because of the composites available
c Different stores are required for ANSI and Unicode, because
c Unicode has so many more characters than ANSI, and sometimes the codepoints are different
c (for characters in the range 80-9F).

c Ordinary spaces should not be used in the base___ stores in order to generate modifier letters representing the
c diacritic in isolation.  This is because we don't want to encourage the user to think that you
c can type a diacritic on a space.  No-break space should be used instead (as per recommendations in Unicode 4.1.0).
c See below for more discussion where store(ModLtrDiac) is defined.

c may display as a comma below.  All this depends on the font, and is a result of some European languages
c using them as alternate glyphs for each other.

c base characters that accept combining marks
c PATCH AREA baseCom

c For visible trigger keys used by themselves (not with keyDiac) and which introduce combining marks, 
c it can be helpful to limit them so they only generate combining marks with certain base characters.  
c That way, you can avoid introducing combining marks when people intend to type something else.  
c
c List in the stores below the base characters that can appear with each combining mark, then make use of these stores
c later at "PATCH AREA individual diacritics" (see instructions there).
c For example:
c store(baseComGrave)         U+0197 U+0268 U+00C6 U+00E6         c U+0300 COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT
c
c Not all diacritics require these stores.
c If there are diacritics that are always represented with combining marks OR whose trigger
c key is not likely to be typed by itself (e.g. because it is an invisible CTRL combination), 
c then it may not be necessary to provide a base store for them.
c IS THIS TRUE? NEED TO THINK THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRIGGER KEYS AND SEQUENCES, AND WHETHER THEY NEED 
c baseCom STORES FOR ANY REASON.  
c Many are listed below in comments anyway, for convenience in adding this feature if necessary, but I haven't
c attempted to maintain a complete list of diacritics here.
c
c If you are concerned about being able to type diacritics in isolation, do not attempt to include spaces or no-break spaces
c in the baseCom stores.  For one thing, it probably wouldn't be effective, and it might actually interfere with
c later code that handles diacritics in isolation.  See "PATCH AREA diacritics in isolation".
c 
c 2005-03-25: In the current version of the keyboard, it is only necessary (and only helpful) to list base characters here
c   which are not listed in the diacritic's base_(diacritic)_ store above.  If there is a composite, it will be introduced, 
c   whether the user wants it or not.  So, to block an unwanted change to a composite you have to remove the base character and the
c   composite from the appropriate base_(diacritic)_ and _(diacritic)_ stores above.
c   But, if I ever change the keyboard so that combining marks are always introduced first
c   and only later collapsed to composites, then this section of the code could be used 
c   to block unwanted composites from being produced too.  That is, the keyboard could be easily modified
c   so as not to produce any change for a particular combination of base + trigger key, neither to a combining mark or 
c   a composite character, simply by not listing the base character here.  There would be no need to remove the base character 
c   and the composite from the base_(diacritic)_ and _(diacritic)_ stores above.  It would provide a more centralized, consistent, 
c   and easily modifiable way to add or subtract base+diacritic combinations from the keyboard.
c   On the other hand, wouldn't that *require* one to list a new base character in both stores, at least if the baseCom store
c   was used at all? That doesn't sound like an improvement!
c

c Stores for diacritics in isolation

c Some base characters should never be followed by combining marks.
c This store shouldn't normally need to be changed, unless you want to add other characters that you
c don't want to accidentally pu diacritics on (e.g. digits, punctuation, symbols, modifier letters).
c                       space  
store(baseComIllegal)   " "   
c PROBLEMS: 
c I can't seem to get CR, LF, or TAB into this list using Unicode codepoints.
c I *can* get them in as virtual keys, but they don't seem to match anything in the context in the later code that tries 
c   to use them; maybe control characters are not put into the context.
c At any rate, it looks like we can't use this mechanism to prevent combining marks from going on CR, LF, or TAB, 
c   and probably other control characters.

c To generate modifier letter diacritics and other spacing diacritics, we're not treating them the same as composite characters,
c using the base_(diacritic)_ and _(diacritic)_ stores, but rather handling all of them as a distinct set.  Reasons:
c 1) To generate modifier letters using keyDiac in an approach that treated them exactly like composite characters, 
c    we'd have to implement support for composites with keyDiac, either adding rules for keyDiac 
c    for a couple dozen diacritics, several of which would not need rules for composites except for this one modifier letter.
c    Either that, or move all handling of composites to a separate group.  Either way, this would be a pretty 
c    major set of changes, one that I'm not convinced is all that important for most letter+diacritic combinations.
c    That is, combining marks are supposed to behave exactly the same as composites, so it really shouldn't matter,
c    and when it does matter now, it's mostly because the standard isn't fully implemented, so it will matter less and less
c    as time goes on.
c 2) But, it *is* important to provide support for modifier letter diacritics, and to prefer them to using combining marks.  
c    The reason is that Word (and perhaps other applications) do not treat no-break space plus a combining mark as a 
c    composite character, for the purpose of cursor movement and the DELETE key.  
c 3) This, in turn, is probably related to the fact that Unicode does not provide canonical decompositions for modifier letter
c    diacritics, so there is no requirement to treat no-break space plus a combining mark as a single character.  And, this
c    could have ramifications in other applications too.    
c Thus, we have a separate pair of stores to handle all modifier letter diacritics as one unified set, 
c independent of the composite characters.

c Based on a suggestion by Lorna Priest (2005-03-22), when there are spacing diacritics both in Latin-1 and in the modifier
c letter block, we'll use the modifier letters, assuming the ones in the Latin-1 are there primarily for compatibility with 
c the older standard.  But, of course, for the ANSI keyboard, we need to use to use the ones
c in Latin-1.

c Diacritics in apparent isolation

c Block diacritics after ordinary space and other illegal characters, regardless of whether they are
c typed with keyDiac or with single triggers.  This code won't prevent all cases of this sort;
c there are probably lots of things the user could do to get around these restrictions.  But,
c this should be helpful to screen out accidental insertion of combining marks.
  c Discard any invisible trigger keys in this context.
    any(baseComIllegal)                 + any(InvisibleTrigger)    > context beep
    any(baseComIllegal) outs(keyDiac)   + any(InvisibleTrigger)    > context beep
  c Visible trigger keys should not be discarded, but rather passed to the output unchanged.
    c When they are used without keyDiac, this is accomplished by not including space etc. in the baseCom store for the diacritic.
    c   Don't try to block it here; a rule here would probably be of the same weight as the rules that invoke the baseCom_(diacitic)_ stores,
    c   and thus the attempt might be in vain.  Rather, rely on warnings not to put space in baseCom_(diacritic)_
    c When they follow keyDiac, we have to do something special here to block the general invocation of the keyDiac rule.
    any(baseComIllegal) outs(keyDiac)   + any(VisibleTrigger)      > context index(VisibleTrigger,3)   
c Also attempt to block combining marks when the context is unknown or at the beginning of the file. 
c (DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK IN KEYMAN 6.0.155.0, BUT MIGHT GET FIXED LATER.)
    nul                 + any(InvisibleTrigger) > beep
    nul outs(keyDiac)   + any(InvisibleTrigger) > context beep  
    nul outs(keyDiac)   + any(VisibleTrigger)   > context index(VisibleTrigger,3)

c On the other hand we DO allow diacritics after no-break space; that's how we get diacritics in apparent isolation.
c Some of these may actually be encoded as spacing diacritics or modifier letter diacritics, others as combining marks.

c However, normally we will require keyDiac in order to get diacritics in isolation, rather than using trigger keys by themselves.
c This way, we can avoid introducing combining marks or modifier letters when what the user may want is the 
c ordinary character from a visible trigger key, such as apostrophe, immediately after a no-break space.
    c PATCH AREA diacritics in isolation 
    c   If you want to be able to use single trigger keys with no-break space to type diacritics in isolation, 
    c     comment out the next two lines.
    c   If you want to require use of keyDiac, use the next two lines.
    c   If you make change here, also make a change at "PATCH AREA diacritics in isolation ANSI"
    outs(nbsp) + any(InvisibleTrigger)  > context beep
    outs(nbsp) + any(VisibleTrigger)    > context index(VisibleTrigger,2)
c Two comments about how these two rules work:
c a) They must take precedence over the rules that use single trigger keys
c    to generate modifier letters and the general rules that introduce combining marks at 1st keypress.
c    Thus, they must come before those other rules in the source code.
c b) It is not sufficient to rely on the absence of no-break space in the baseCom stores 
c    to block the special meaning of visible trigger keys. That only blocks insertion
c    of combining marks, and we also need to block insertion of modifier letters.
c    The above rule does both.
        
c Generate modifier letters rather than using combining marks for diacritics in isolation, whenever they are available.
c a. See discussion above, where the store ModLtrDiac is defined, as to why we take this approach rather than
c    treating modifier letter diacritics as composite characters.
c b. In this section, we provide for typing the modifier letter either with our without keyDiac.
c    Just because things are coded this way here, however, doesn't mean that the first rule will actually work,
c    because there are other rules that interfere with it.  (See above at "PATCH AREA diacritics in isolation".)
outs(nbsp)                  + any(Trig4ModLtrDiac)  > index(ModLtrDiac,2)
outs(nbsp) outs(keyDiac)    + any(Trig4ModLtrDiac)  > index(ModLtrDiac,3)
any(ModLtrDiac)             + [K_BKSP]              > outs(nbsp)
c 
c Providing general 2nd keypress behavior (like that for ordinary uses of diacritics typed with single trigger keys)
c is problematic.  The following sort of thing will not work, because it does not require the trigger key to be the one
c that corresponds to the modifier letter.  (It would be nice to be able to use index() on the left side of the rule, 
c but that is not syntactically allowed.)  As a result, visible triggers like "x" and "n" at the beginning
c of the next word will replace any modifier letter with a no-break space.
c any(ModLtrDiac)            + any(InvisibleTrigger) > outs(nbsp)
c any(ModLtrDiac)            + any(VisibleTrigger)   > outs(nbsp) index(VisibleTrigger,2)
c The above are an attempt to have the 2nd keypress reverse the effect of the first keypress; similar problems would arise
c if we just wanted to ignore a 2nd keypress.
c The only way around the problem would be to list every specific combination of modifier letter and diacritic here--
c probably not worth the bother.                        
c 
c But, we *do* need the special 2nd keypress behavior for double diacritics:
U+02CA              + any(keyAcute) > U+02DD    c 2nd keypress: single to double acute (modifier letter)
U+02DD              + [K_BKSP]      > U+02CA    c backspace: double back to single
c NB: there is no modifier letter for double grave, except a middle height one, but we've generally avoided the middle-height
c   modifier letters
c Oddly, in Doulos SIL Text, the combining mark is higher on a nbsp 
c   than on an ordinary lower-case letter in TIKE, and higher than other modifier letters, but in Word the 
c   combining mark is at the right height: the same as the other modifier letters and its height on a lower-case letter.
c   In contrast, U+02F5 MODIFIER LETTER MIDDLE DOUBLE GRAVE ACCENT is too low in both programs,
c   as is the middle double acute accent.
c So, it looks like we should use nbsp plus the combining mark for double grave by itself.
U+02CB              + any(keyGrave) > outs(nbsp) U+030F     c 2nd keypress: single to double grave (modifier letter)
outs(nbsp) U+030F   + [K_BKSP]      > U+02CB
c 
c And certainly, it is not important to provide 3rd keypress behavior for visible triggers: How many times would a person want
c a modifier letter immediately followed by its corresponding visible trigger key?  Very rarely.

c Don't provide any workaround changes for 2nd and 3rd instances of the trigger; 
c the combinations should be so rare as to not be needed normally,
c so there's no need to complicate the keyboard to provide them.
c But, if we ever reactivate the following code, we will probably need to distinguish between visible and invisible triggers
c after two instances of keyDiac.

c INSTRUCTIONS FOR PATCHING DIACRITIC RULES 
c 
c Separate rules are required for the 1st, 2nd, and sometimes the 3rd keypress of the trigger key.
c Typing the trigger key a second time should remove the diacritic, plus insert any visible trigger key.
c For visible triggers, a 3rd keypress should result in the diacritic being reinserted, in addition to retaining
c the normal output from the trigger key that was inserted by the 2nd keypress rule.
c
c How you write these rules depends on whether the trigger character is visible or invisible.
c In addition, you sometimes need to provide for keyDiac sequences here.

c To process a visible trigger key, follow this pattern:
c any(baseGrave)                   + outs(keyGrave)        > index(Grave,1)                       c 1st keypress, composite
c any(Grave)                       + [K_BKSP]              > index(baseGrave,1)                   c backspace after composite, mimics behavior of backspace after combining mark
c any(Grave)                       + outs(keyGrave)        > index(baseGrave,1)    outs(keyGrave) c 2nd keypress, composite
c any(baseGrave)    outs(keyGrave) + outs(keyGrave)        > index(Grave,1)        outs(keyGrave) c 3rd keypress, composite
c any(baseComGrave)                + outs(keyGrave)        > context   U+0300                     c 1st keypress, combining
c U+0300                           + outs(keyGrave)        >                       outs(keyGrave) c 2nd keypress, combining
c any(baseComGrave) outs(keyGrave) + outs(keyGrave)        > context(1) U+0300     outs(keyGrave) c 3rd keypress, combining
c
c Note that, if visible trigger keys are used to generate combining marks, you should establish a store(baseCom_(diacritic)_)
c for them for use on the rules for 1st and 3rd keypress, so that they are only interpreted as trigger keys following 
c certain base characters and definitely not following an ordinary space.  See above at "PATCH AREA baseCom". 


c To process an invisible trigger key, follow this pattern:
c any(baseGrave)          + outs(keyGrave)        > index(Grave,1)        c 1st keypress, composite
c any(Grave)              + [K_BKSP]              > index(baseGrave,1)    c backspace after composite, mimics behavior of backspace after combining mark
c any(Grave)              + outs(keyGrave)        > context beep          c 2nd keypress, composite
c                         + outs(keyGrave)        > U+0300                c 1st keypress, combining
c U+0300                  + outs(keyGrave)        > context beep          c 2nd keypress, combining   
c
c Note that, there is no need for a baseCom_(diacritic)_ store to restrict the insertion of combining marks. 
c Indeed, combining marks *should* be inserted across-the-board, without regard to the preceding character,
c when the trigger key is invisible; if the invisible trigger character is typed 
c but not translated to a diacritic, it may be introduced into the data stream as an invisible 
c character and sent to the application, causing strange behavior.  
c
c The above code has the effect of ignoring the second keypress and beeping to alert the user that it
c has done so.  Alternately, you could code the 2nd keypress behavior 
c in a way that the effect of the trigger key is reversed, the same as if the backspace key is pushed.
c any(Grave)              + outs(keyGrave)        > index(baseGrave,1)    c 2nd keypress, composite
c U+0300                  + outs(keyGrave)        > nul                   c 2nd keypress, combining   
c 
c There is no need to provide 3rd keypress behavior for invisible trigger keys, because an instance of 
c the trigger key should never get put into the context (at least, if the above code works as intended).
c
c Actually, a couple of diacritics have double versions, in which the 2nd keypress is used to generate the double version 
c of the diacritic; in such cases, it is the 3rd keypress that must be ignored.  (In fact, grave accent is one of those, so 
c the actual code for the grave accent below does not follow the above pattern.)


c keyDiac sequences for composites
c
c In addition to the above options, we sometimes need to handle sequences of keyDiac plus the trigger key.
c Most keyDiac sequences generate combining marks, and when they do, they are handled by code above
c that selects the correct combining mark using the CombMark store.
c However, if you want keyDiac to generate composites, you have to include additional rules in this block that watch for 
c the keyDiac sequence.  Such lines are just like the examples for the 1st keypress, but with outs(keyDiac) before the "+".
c 
c There shouldn't be any need to provide special processing for a second or third instance
c of a keyDiac sequence.  The keyDiac sequence should be a rare enough sequence that there
c is no need for a special workaround for it.  Besides, by not providing any special 2nd 
c keypress behavior, keyDiac can be used to stack two instances of the same diacritic, if that's ever necessary.

c
c The use of keyAcute twice to get the double acute will make it unwise to use a visible trigger key for keyAcute (e.g. apostrophe),
c because the 2nd keypress can't output base character plus keyAcute.  So, either you'd have to find some other way to 
c keyboard the double acute, or you'd forego the ability to easily output base character plus keyAcute.  
c Actually, though, you wouldn't want to output keyAcute itself on the 2nd keypress, because of the problem
c that apostrophe may also be used for typing dotless exclamation (see comments above at PATCH AREA acute and saltillo).
c So, what you'd actually have is something like this leftover old code:
c any(Acute)                            + outs(keyAcute)        > index(baseAcute,1)    outs(nrmlRsltAcute)  c 2nd keypress, composite

c any(baseComAcute) outs(nrmlRsltAcute) + outs(keyAcute)        > context(1) U+0301     outs(nrmlRsltAcute)  c 3rd keypress, combining
c This extra problem with the ambiguity of apostrophe for acute accent and saltillo is another reason not to use ordinary apostrophe
c for keyAcute.

c you should also change the definition of the store nrmlRsltAcute near the beginning of this file.

c FRACTIONS

c ASSUMES:
c The store FracSlash (defined above) contains the character that should be used for the slash in fractions,
c typically either the ordinary slash or U+2044 FRACTION SLASH

c This code only handles fractions involving ordinary unsigned integers, not formulas, as numerator and denominator.
c If you need anything fancier than that, you should use an equation editor.

c Numerator
c for multi-digit numerators: once superscripting is started, continue it 
any(RsdDigit)           + any(baseDigit)    > context index(RsdDigit,2)                     

c Operator
c When encountering a typed slash, it either gets translated to whatever we're using to represent the slash in fractions,
c or in a special case, to a composite when the numerator is exactly 1.
any(RsdDigit) any(RsdDigit) + '/'       > context outs(FracSlash)   c with more than one digit in numerator: whatever slash we're using 
U+00B9                      + '/'       > U+215F                    c special case: composite FRACTION NUMERATOR ONE
U+215F                      + [K_BKSP]  > U+00B9                    c undo FRACTION NUMERATOR ONE
any(RsdDigit)               + '/'       > context outs(FracSlash)   c default: whatever slash we're using

c Denominator
c
c Switch to subscript after 2 superscript digits and slash. This also blocks composite fractions for 2-digit numerators.
any(RsdDigit) any(RsdDigit) any(FracSlash) + any(baseDigit) > context index(LowDigit,4)     
c                                                                                            
c There are composite fractions for certain combinations of single-digit numerators and single-digit denominators
c If a second digit is found for the denominator, then the composite must be unbundled again.
c (Those involving a numerator 1 are commented out because I think they won't be needed, but I'm keeping them just in case.)

c ========================================================================================================
c Line-breaking and control characters
c My original idea was to support these characters with the same keys as in Word, so that 
c they would be available both inside and outside Word.
c However, Word uses different characters for most of them, so redefining these key sequences to 
c produce the Unicode character would give incorrect results in Word.
c That's why most of these are commented out.

c 
c Pass certain key combinations through unchanged to the application.
c These key combinations have special meanings to applications like Word, and so the application
c needs to see the key combination itself, not the character that it is normally translated to by Keyman.

c Diacritics in apparent isolation

c Technically we don't need to block diacritics after ordinary space in the ANSI keyboard; they are blocked automaticaly
c by virtue of the fact that there are no combining marks to insert.  But, it is helpful to the user to beep,
c to show that they've done something wrong, and to remind them that they need to type no-break space if they
c want to do diacritics in isolation (to maintain consistency with the Unicode keyboard).

c PATCH AREA diacritics in isolation ANSI
c   If you want to be able to use single trigger keys with no-break space to type diacritics in isolation, 
c     comment out the next two lines.
c   If you want to require use of keyDiac, use the next two lines.
c   If you make a change here, make the same change at "PATCH AREA diacritics in isolation" above.

outs(nbsp) + any(VisibleTrigger)    > context index(VisibleTrigger,2)

c ANSI Diacritics (all composite)

c The general-purpose use of keyDiac with any diacritic trigger key is not supported for ANSI, because
c - there are no combining marks in ANSI to be forced onto base characters that don't normally take them or 
c   to be used to provide two instances of the same diacritic
c - there is no particular point in supporting the redundant use of keyDiac with trigger keys that normally
c   occur alone (this is only supported in a general way for Unicode because that's the easiest way to force the diacritics
c   when they wouldn't otherwise be inserted)
c To put it another way, the uses of keyDiac that are relevant for ANSI Latin-1 are:
c - any that involve composite characters (there may not be any at this point)
c - spacing versions of diacritics, which are handled above

c saltillo
c PATCH AREA saltillo (ANSI; see above for Unicode)
c Use the next line if you type saltillos more often than apostrophes.  Otherwise, comment it out.
c + "'" > outs(saltillo-A)
c Saltillo can be converted back to apostrophe by following it with keyUp or keyDown; see stores for chevrons and quotes.
c Or, if you prefer, use the next line:
c outs(saltillo-A)    + "'"   > "'"           c convert saltillo to apostrophe by typing a second apostrophe
c In either case, you probably want to keep the following line always:
