Bukawa keyboard
==============

Description
-----------
This is an upgrade of the Keyman keyboard for Bukawa, with the inclusion of long-press touch-keys to access the special characters on smartphones.

COMPUTER KEYBOARDS - The Bukawa special characters are initiated on a desktop or laptop keyboard using the deadkey "[" (left square bracket).
While the special characters could have been assigned to letters such as 'j', 'z' or 'q' that are not used in Bukawa, the use of a deadkey means that both Bukawa and English text can be typed without having to change keyboards.

The following are the key combinations that result in the special characters for Bukawa:

[ + j > ŋ
[ + n > ŋ

[ + J > Ŋ
[ + N > Ŋ

(Noth 'n' and "j" have been designated as the 'base' key because both have been used in other keyboards that were built for Bukawa)

[ + e > ê

[ + E > Ê

[ + o > ô

[ + O > Ô

[ + q > ö

[ + Q > Ö

[ + h > ́  (OR [ + / ; high tone on vowels)*

[ + l > ̀̀  (OR [ + \ ; low tone on vowels)*

* NOTE: to add a tone marker to a vowel (including both upper case vowels and the other special Bukawa vowels),  key in the vowel first and then the tone marker. With most Unicode fonts the tone marker will distinguish between normal vowels and vowels with the circumflex marker or umlaut and position itself appropriately.

Note also that if the user wants to key the square bracket itself then keying it twice overrides the deadkey function and pruduces a square bracket. (i.e. [ + [ > [ )

SMARTPHONE KEYBOARDS - a long press on the same base keys ("e", "o", "q", "n", "j", and "h" or "l") should bring up a pop-up menu from which the special characters can be chosen. Note that both the upper and lower case versions of the special characters can be accessed via the standard lower-case key.
