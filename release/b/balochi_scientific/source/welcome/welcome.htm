<h1><img src='..\balochi_scientific.ico' alt='' style='vertical-align: middle' /> Balochi Scientific Keyman keyboard for Keyman Desktop</h1>

<p>This keyboard layout is designed for transcribing Balochi languages.  It includes an on screen keyboard which can be viewed by clicking on the Keyman icon and selecting the On Screen Keyboard menu item. Similar keyboards are also available for other desktop and mobile platforms.</p>

<img src='keyboard_layout.png'>

<p>The keyboard layout is the same as that of the English keyboard; but, as you type, certain key sequences would output certain characters. For example, if you type a semicolon ";" and then key "A", the output would be <b>ƒÅ</b>.</p>
<p>See <a href="balochi_scientific.pdf">this document</a> for all the key combinations.</p>

<p>For Android and iOS, you may use either long press or key combinations. Long press on "a" and more related characters will show up.</p>
