Burushaski (بروشسکی) Perso/Arabic Change History

2.0.2 (27 May 2025)
-----------------
At the request of the community, several improvements were made. While writing a book containing Arabic religious text, community members realized the need for specific Arabic ligatures to be included both in the keyboard and the font. As a result, the following ligatures were added: Bismill, Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Alihi (Full), Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Allihi (Symbol), Razi Allahu, and Jazm. Additionally, in the font, the Allah Ligature was integrated into the lookup to render (ال ہ) as ﷲ." In this context, the guide has also been improved.
